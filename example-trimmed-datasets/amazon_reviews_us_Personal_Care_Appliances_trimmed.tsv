I should have bought one of these long ago! It's totally worth every penny after you use it a few times. There is NO need to get the next model up if all you want is a good shave. The next model up (the T990 I believe) charges in 1 hour vs. 10 hours for this model, and it has an LCD screen to show battery life. For as often as you'll use this trimmer, plugging it in overnight while you're sleeping is not that big a deal. This model doesn't have an LCD screen to tell you battery life, but do you really wanna pay more than double just for a quicker charge and a display of battery life? Not me!<br />The guard on the trimmer is smooth and glides easily over your skin. The T860 trims effortlessly - never snagging, pulling, or getting clogged with your hair. Battery life stays consistent until the last minute before it's completely drained. To eliminate hair's static attration to the rubber dial used to change cutting length, spray it with a quick spritz of Static Guard. Otherwise, just rinse it off when you're done; the hair rinses off easily with water.<br />This trimmer is made to trim facial hair, but it works GREAT on the legs, chest, stomach, and any other areas you'd imagine shaving! The 9 different settings insure that you keep the hair on, but under control...nice and tidy appearence. We all know how hairy we guys can get! I like to use a #3 on my legs, but you'd want to start out with a 6, then go DOWN ONE LEVEL AT A TIME to ensure that you don't cut TOO MUCH OFF.<br />DO NOT USE THE GUARDLESS TRIMMER WITHOUT READING THE DIRECTIONS! I nipped my skin (drawing a little blood) several times. Read directions and see illustrations for proper use without the guard. In any case, I do not recommend using it guardless in sensitive areas as it can be painful.<br />Anyway, if you're wondering whether you should buy this trimmer, DO. You will NOT regret the INVESTMENT! It saves so much time!	2004-02-10

There's no Caller ID/Call Waiting Caller ID for one.<br />I dunno; I guess they assume every user is a crotchety oldster who doesn't want to be bothered with a bunch of newfangled technology.

The shaving heads are mounted in such a way that gives them the freedom to depress independently of one another, to better adapt to the unique contours of your face.  Another advantage to this razor is that the shaving heads can be washed under the faucet.  This is a feature that the Quadra system razors share with the more expensive Spectra system razors.<br />This razor is light-years better than my previous Norelco.  My last Norelco was the 885, bought back in 1991.  That razor always irritated my skin, especially the neck area.  Although it did last nine years.  Three years ago, I switched to the Braun Syncro system.  The Braun worked very well for me.  Anyway, I decided to give Norelco another try.  I was very surprised, and impressed, to say the least.  This Quadra shaves just as close and just as comfortable as the Braun Syncro.  And, it is very quiet.  So far, I am only getting 35 minutes of shaving time per charge.  But, I believe that the battery will reach its full capacity after a few more discharge and charge cycles.<br />For me, it is an even choice between this Norelco and the Braun.  I can readily recommend either one.  I suppose you just might have to try both and see which one will work better for you.  One thing is obvious though.  Either one will save you money in the long run, compared to using a blade shaver like the Mach 3, for example.  The long-term cost of periodically buying replacement blades for a Mach 3 or Sensor Excel can easily exceed the price of either one of the electrics.  I will admit, however, that neither of the electric razors can match the closeness of the Mach 3.	2004-02-03

Don't waste your money, it's much much worse than the sonicare.  The sonicare brush vibrates back and forth against your teeth.  The ultrasonex is much less sophisticated and vibrates in all directions, so half the time it's actually banging directly into your teeth.  It felt very harsh on my gums.<br />It looks and feels like somebody just stuck a toothbrush on the end of what in polite company would be called a &quot;marital aid&quot;.	2004-02-03

They only slide half way open to expose two compartments at a time.<BR>3.  If you slide off the container top all the way, the sections are numbered 1,2,4,3.  It's hard to explain here but the numbering system and the top that only slides open half way are very confusing to someone who is elderly.  If the alarm goes off and she goes to slide open the top all she sees are numbers, not the meal or time of day.  She has to put together that if it's the #2 alarm going off then she should take the pills in the #2 compartment.<BR>4.  The alram startles my Mom.  It goes off again if she doesn't hit the right button.  After three times it just stops going off so if she's not in the room when it goes off those 3 times, then she misses it. <BR>5.

Also I was mildly worried about my gums getting less firm than they had used to be.<br />1) The Ultrasonex brush head is larger and the vibrations are stronger compared to Sonicare. One is able to hit the tooth surfaces AND quite a lot of the gum surface. I personally like the larger stronger approach but I notice that some people like very small and soft brush heads.<br />2) In addition to getting my teeth squeaky clean, my gums are getting a terrific massage and I notice that they have become firmer<br />After having had it for a couple of months now I've become a fan and have bought two more!

At this price, accuracy is a given.  My scale is accurate.  The added features do not add value, however.  <br />The &quot;memory&quot; function simply gives the last previous session's information.  Having memory capability should provide at least ten session's information, perhaps more, to provide a meaningful trend.  The product description is somewhat misleading in this respect.<br />The body fat monitor is a) inaccurate and b) inconsistent.  The manual even explains that your readings will be different at different times of the day.  The best I can say about this feature is that it MAY be helpful giving you a sense of progress provided you only take readings at a specific time of day (mornings are not recommended).  Keep in mind that seasonal issues (dry skin in winter, vacation in Hawaii) will alter the monitor's results.<br />I like Tanita's accuracy--it should be accurate for the price they charge for their scales.  Everything else is basically useless in my opinion.  I highly recommend you look for a Tanita branded scale that is simply a digital scale.  The HD17, even though it has the memory function, appears to provide the same level of accuracy but saves $30+ over the BF681.	2004-01-29

My wife got me this Norelco for Christmas and it has completely sold me.  <br />First, shave quality is very good.  You can either enjoy a good shave in under a minute or else give a few extra moments (3, maybe 4 minutes max for me) and get near-blade-quality closeness.  Either option leaves you with no mess to clean up and no cuts or irritation.  The user manual recommends that you use the shaver exclusively for the first month so that your skin can get used to the shaver.  This is also good a good time for the user to get his technique down - you do need to figure out which way your beard grows on all parts that you shave.  During this period, I also noticed that you need less and less pressure as your face gets acclimated, so the comfort just gets better and better.  <br />So maybe all electrics deliver a good shave these days - what makes this one stand out?  First and foremost, ease of use.  The Quadra rinses clean under hot water and even displays on the LCD when it needs to be cleaned.  It also shows how many minutes of charge that you have remaining;  recharging the unit to a full 40 minutes takes less than an hour and you can use it while it charging with the included cord.  The flip-up trimmer is great for sideburns and over the ears.  If you've got a sudden appointment or event want to look cleaned up like you just came from the barber shop, then it does a fine job.  <br />Finally, all of this functionality is packed inside a lightweight, attractive, durable case.  This little wonder has won over a long-time blade proponent.	2004-01-29

Still, I wanted something that would reduce the occassion nicks and perhaps cut down the time spent in shaving.  I had used a Norelco several decades before and was skeptical whether all the claims of a closer shave were really true.  Well, I became a true believer on day one.  It gets whiskers below the nose and in the chin area that had often caused nicks with a razor, and overall my face is perhaps even smoother with this razor.  The rechargable feature and LED display that identifies the amount of time remaining is great, as is the fact that the razor washes clean by simply clicking open the head and running the unit under running cold water.  Can't think of a thing I'd change about this unit.	2004-01-29

And because I had made several passes over my neck, the Syncro caused significant razor burn. I returned it and picked up this Spectra. The spectra is very comfortable, and took care of all of the whiskers on my neck - long and short. It did not create ANY irritation on my neck.<br />The comfort settings are nice - I use the Normal setting during the week, taking my time and getting a baby smooth shave. On the weekends I use the Sensitive setting - making for a very quick shave, but not as close. You can use the sensitive setting, and after a few passes over the same area, end up with a super smooth shave, however.<br />I really liked the cleaning feature on the Syncro - it made the shaver look great and smell terrific. So, for the Spectra, after cleaning, I use Remington Shaver Saver Spray, which leaves a very similar scent (to the Syncro cleaner) and keeps the shaver lubed and running properly. So, if you are hesitant to switch because of the cleaner, fear not. The Shaver Saver spray is a great substitute.<br />The shave can be perfect, once you find the right method for your particular beard. I take my time, make a couple of passes, then go in a circular motion over my entire face, feeling for any residual stubble. This shaver has not created ANY irritation after multiple passes. It does not leave strays or longer stubble, and because of the head design, you can move itin any direction without risking razor burn. I shaved with a Gillette razor for the past 20 years - always with the grain to avoid burn and bleeding. This Spectra shaves my tough beard against the grain, making it baby smooth, and very comfortable. It is worth every penny. 5 stars!	2004-01-24

I have used electric shavers in the past with no variable in the degree of results I obtained....none of them worked on my beard! They left me patchy, irittated and still stubbly! Like many, I was very interested in the Braun Synchro and received one as a Christmas gift. The Braun is a fine shaver and I had better success with it than any other previous electric model. I received the Panasonic Wet Dry as a gift and thought I would try it out. This shaver, for me, shaves AS CLOSE AS A BLADE AND WITHOUT THE IRRITATION! Clean up is quick and easy and you can shave in the shower for the best shave yet. I am still convinced that the Braun is an excellent dry shaver, but for me, the point is when I shave with each doing what each is capable of, I get a better, closer, smoother shave with my Panasonic wet dry. Is it the world's best shaver? You bet, for me at least...and, like autombobiles, different models and brands may better suit other individual beards. Mine is heavy and dark and this shaver mows through it without any nicks or cuts. My recomendation is to try it in the shower with a fog free mirror and with a good shaving oil like The total shaving solution for men. The results are world class. The pricing may make this a hesitant choice for some but the payback on mach III blades is pretty quick...and the results, in my opinion, are better. Five Stars, only because the rating system won't let me use 10!	2004-01-22

Nothing compares to the hassle free couple weeks I've just had since this great little epilator came into my life.<br />My first five days without having bristles were celebratory.  What fun!  I kept asking friends to feel my legs so I could share the joy.  I also have used this product on my tiresome chin hairs that have plagued me for longer than I care to remember.  I just take a minute and all my worries of having missed a stray hair are history.  Hooray!<br />There is a sting associated with using this system but not unmanagble.  It's also a good idea to pull your skin taut when you are trying to epilate...shall we say...any curves that could stand to be a little tighter.  It takes a bit of time to get all the hairs off...but the payoff is NO SHAVING FOR OVER A WEEK!  Good trade off in my book.<br />The silver mesh bag is handy as well as 'girly', making it a great addition to my beauty regime.  The razor module that is included is something I have chosen to use under my arms.  (Epilating the arm pits wasn't my favorite.)  Small consolation for such a great gadget.<br />If you are sick and tired of plucking...getting out the reading glasses or a bright light to see where those stray hairs are, or stripping your legs with gooey wax, give the Braun Silk-Epil Eversoft System a try.<br />My satan PJ'S just glide over my legs now!<br />L	2004-01-20

I have always liked the Norelco beard trimmers and this one is no exception.  With 9 settings you can get pretty much any length you need.<br />The other two items in the set i may give 2 stars to so they drag down the rating overall.  The d-finer is like a torture device because it does not always cut the hair and will sometimes yank at it instead (owch).  However, it does work at giving nice defined lines in your facial hair so that is nice.  The nose hair trimmer is a &quot;run of the mill&quot; one and does an OK job.  It does not trim very close at all so if you want a tight trime then this nose hair trimmer is not for you.	2004-01-14

But if the owner/recipient of this watch is NOT blind, and you would like from time to time to be able to see the time by looking at the watch, forget it. My watch arrived already malfunctioned via UPS, and I very much doubt it was any fault of UPS. It would be the first. The watch was packed extremely poorly. It arrived in a rectangular box large enough to contain a lava lamp. This was entirely unnecessary, but maybe it was Maxiaids way of attempting to justify the $10 shipping charge with an impressively sized box. The shipping alone will cost you more than the watch itself, if all you plan to purchase is the watch. The problem was that you could not read the first digit of the minutes. For example, if the time is 5:02. the watch would read 5:||2, leaving the top and bottom of the &quot;0&quot; unconnected. This was also the case with other numbers in the tens place. The 2 and 4 looked like deformed tetris pieces, and so on and so forth. The watch comes with a &quot;Certificate of Warranty&quot; claiming that &quot;each one is tested electronically and inspected by qualified watchmakers&quot;. Well, if this were true, then why did I receive a defective watch?! If you would like to contact customer service, you will need to call long distance. The 1-800 number is only for placing orders. I however, was not willing to trouble myself with returning the watch to the MAXI Repair Service with postage PREPAID, along with another $5.00 shipping and handling, as stated in the Certificate of Warranty. And even then, how many weeks or months would it take to receive what I should have received the 1st time? Instead, I figured it would be a lot easier and a lot less hassle, to just smash the thing up with a hammer. So I did just that. The one star rating I give is to UPS who I have always found to be reliable. If however, you only want to listen to the watch speak, and do not care about the appearance ofthe time, then this might be the watch for you. But if you expect both as it should be, you're taking a chance.<BR>No compre este reloj si ud. quiere ver las horas tambien.

In just under a week of regular use my gum tissue looks and feels healthier than it ever, *ever* has.  I still wouldn't give up flossing with quality floss though.  Oral-B's Ultra Floss is a tad on the pricey side but well worth the extra investment. (Okay, okay so I'm dental hygiene nut!)<br />The only reason this *particular* product gets 3 stars after all that praise is because the water irrigation system was flat out terrible.  Like another reviewer I, too, agree that the power at the highest setting is awfully low.  I could swish water around in my mouth at greater velocity all by myself and saved some money.<br />BUT, If you are interested in a truly awesome tool for fantastic at-home dental care, I highly recommend this new professional series but definately *without* the irrigation system attached.

This is the best shaver I have used so far. Soon after I first started shaving, my brother gave me Norelco shaver for my birthday (and it was about 3 years back). It was okay but somehow I could never shave good with that. Often got irritation and burning sensation everytime I used it. <br />Then I finally decided to switch to razor, which I had been using since I found this little Braun toy. To be very honest, the razor was not bad either (Mach III turbo) and I was happy with it. But then I got Braun 7680 Syncro Smart shaver for christmas; which is supposedly &quot;the best of Braun&quot; BUT that wasnt good for me too. It was close enough but still was harsh on skin and gosh, on the fourth day the spring on the cradle broke and returned it. AND then I finally got this sweet thing, yes &quot;Braun 6690 FreeGlider&quot;. It is REALLY awesome! The conditioner liquid is no joke, it gives you that cool sensation on your skin (and conditions too) .. I felt NO irritations at all. and shave was as close as MACHIII without the fuss of gel or foam.<br />I think one of the the best parts of this shaver is the blades are not arranged in triangle. (That doesnt make sense to me). Being straing, it makes so much more sense. I can handle it better and with much more precision. Trimmer doest a flawless job too. Yeah, these days I have perfect sideburns and clean face (very important to make a mark on my job line) . Other thing I like very much is that the cradle is simple and relatively small, and not like &quot;Braun 7680 Syncro Smart shavers&quot; which took almost all my counter space on bathroom. Cradle on these are just perfect to hold it. And oh.. dont forget, you can wash its head with hot water everytime you shave and the blades cleans up in seconds... <br />Talking about all its good part, i think there is something weird about this shaver too.. :( Its handle is little on the thicker side (to accomodate the conditioner cartridge inside it). If you have got a midget hands, i think you should go to local store and get a feel for it. <br />A FINAL NOTE EVERYONE: If you are new to electric shaving, dont think ANY of the shavers will work miracle the first time. Give yourself and your beard and skin atleast 1 week before you start to really enjoy it!	2004-01-09

Panasonic products have extremely strong motors, very sharp, precision blades, and are well-engineered. But the best part is wet shaving with lather. This razor adapts to your regular shaving routine, whether with a mug and brush, out of the Foamy can or from a hot lather machine. The shave is both smoother and closer than with dry shaving. It's almost impossible to nick yourself, and a push button flips the top open so you can rinse the razor under water while shaving. There's also a pop-up sideburn trimmer. When the battery runs down, just pop it on the recharger and plug it in for four hours and it's ready to go. Replacement screens and blades are also readily available. Try wet shaving and you'll never go back to dry (but it can dry shave also for use in the car or on the go). All in all, a great shaver at a great price.	2004-01-08

I, too, experienced the battery problem many of you witnessed (a full charge only lasts a few minutes until the battery is depleted), AND THIS IS THE SECOND 8894XL THAT HAS EXPERIENCED THIS ANOMALY!). It turns out that there was a manufacturing defect (an identified defect in the printed cicuit board of the charging circuit) that has caused this problem!!

I was ready to lay down the 60 bones for a Sonicare and came across this guy.  I figured, for it's price, it's worth a try-even if it only lasted a year or so. <br />I compared it side by side with a friend's Sonicare.  It's not as loud, and doesn't appear to move as much (has a shorter amplitude of it's brush stroke).  The battery doesn't last as long without a recharge, but I can stand to live without a power brush when I travel.<br />In short, this brush isn't as fancy or maybe doesnt even clean your teeth as well as a Sonicare.  It may not last as long or look as pretty either.  Bottom line: it cleans your teeth great and costs less than $20.  Long term reliability is yet to be determined, but none of these things are indestructible.	2004-01-07

I was very excited at first because I unfortunately, like many other older folks, often feel a need to defacate while I am taking a shower.  On occasion I just can't hold it in, and my feces gets on the shower floor, and then my feet and the carpet.  I was really hoping that this product would be the answer to my embarassing problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is not. What the designer seemed to forget is that, when a person is going to the bathroom in the shower, the shower's water continues to flow. The problem was this -- The first time I used this product was just after eating a large meal from Hardees. I had the three piece fried chicken and biscuits and some onion rings and an apple pie.  Big mistake.  I got home and wanted to shower, and sure enough, I suddenly needed to use the toilet, and I gave the 3-in-1 a go.  For a minute or two it seemed ok, and I started to clean my nether regions. But then, suddenly, I looked down and realized that the shower water had filled up the seat's receptacle area, and all of my Hardee's was overflowing onto me and the shower.  This was the exact problem I hoped to avoid with this product, if not worse.<br />So anyway, this product clearly is not well designed and I was very disappointed in it. I am continuing to look for another product that will allow me to shower and defacate comfortably at the same time if necessary.  Also, does anyone know if there are any other similar products that would allow a person to defacate while driving or mowing the lawn??	2004-01-07

Overall, this lil thing lasted pretty well, and I used it daily for about 2-3 years.  It never pulled hairs or left track marks with the guard off lining up sideburns and trimming around my goatee and mustache.  <br />  It did have one drawback though.  While it was easy to use, and frequently zipped through sideburns and goatees with ease, it missed some hairs.  With it set to trim hairs over 1/4 inch long, I had one grow to almost 2 inches long before I found it and used scissors to cut it.<br />  Something went wrong with the battery, and it died recently.  I am not sure if I will buy another or try my luck with another guard system on a fidderent trimmer.	2004-01-07

Unfortunately I read Consumer Reports before buying and not these reviews.  While Consumer Reports rated it the best measurer of fat among those tested they did say it still had shortcomings but nothing like the ones experienced by the reviewers here or by me.  Following the instructions I tested the machine out four times in twelve minutes.  The weight reading was consistent but the four body fat readings I received were 20%, 21%, 24% and 24%.  I can assure you I did not down a pizza in those twelve minutes.  I am resigned to the fact that these machines are not accurate, I would take a water test for that.  But I did expect consistency so that you could measure fat LOSS accurately, for that all you need is a machine to consistently give you the same error with each reading.  Even that is too much to expect I guess.  Back to the pinch test for me.	2004-01-07

Among the multi-blade razors, I found the Schick Quattro to be the best.  In combination with a fine shaving brush and soap, it worked pretty well.  But it was too time consuming, and rather messy.  For years, I'd been a Braun electric razor user and had been using the Braun Syncro for the past 2 years.  But it was rather rough on my face, even after replacing the blades, loud, and cumbersome to clean.  Then I discovered the Norelco Spectra line, which seemingly had all the features I'd been looking for.  I'll just sum up what features mattered to me and how I rate them.<br />1. Shaving Closeness: Good<br />Norelco recommends 3 weeks of exclusive use for your face the adjust to the shave.  I'd been testing out an older Norelco Quadra razor I had, so though I only used the Spectra for a week, I think my face was adjusted fine.  It did a fairly decent job, though I still had to stretch my chin area to get the closest shave.  But for the upper lip area, I still can't figure out how to get it to shave as close as a foil shaver, like the Braun.<br />2. Comfort: Very Good<br />My old Norelco Quadra used to literally pull the hair and it would hurt!  The Braun was abrasive and I'd often need to put on some lotion afterwards.  But I thought the Spectra was very comfortable and did not irritate my sensitive skin.  However, I could not tell much of a difference in the 7 \\"Comfort\\" settings, even when I went from the highest to the lowest setting in comparing this feature.<br />3. Ease of Cleaning: Excellent<br />Does it get any better than just rinsing the heads with water?  The Braun system of cleaning is just plain inefficient and costly.  Why keep a hideous cleaning stand around and pay for the cleaning solution, when you can just rinse with water?<br />4. Display:  Excellent<br />Once you get past the wow factor of how nice the polymer LED looks, it's not much more than just a simple indicator of how long your battery will last.  The other indicators I don't find as useful, though some might.<br />5. Noise: Excellent<br />Compared to the Braun, it's like shaving in stealth mode.  I never realized that electric razors didn't all sound like gas lawn mowers.<br />6. Battery Life: Undeterminable<br />The major reason I decided to get \\"James Bond's Shaver Of Choice\\" over the less expensive model just below it, was that the 8894XL has 100 minute shaving time, as opposed to the 70 minute shaving time of the 8890XL.  As it turns out, the unit I received is defective.  I charged it as the manual suggests and after 4-5 charging cycles, I couldn't get the razor to operate for more than 6 minutes before dying.<br />My choice for electric razors is Norelco, easily.  But I don't plan to replace my defective unit with another 8894XL.  I don't find the differences between it and the 8890XL to be enough to justify the cost difference (only thirdy dolores on Amazon actually).  But considering my 8894XL had charging issues, I don't feel like going through another return, if I get another defective one.  As soon as I receive my credit, I will probably order the 8890XL.han just a simple indicator of how long your battery will last.

The trick listed later about running for two hours with the heads open to run the battery down, then full recharge seems to have worked. No further problems with battery, charge or life. Heads are still very, very nice. The washout feature is the best part of the whole deal. Excellent and comfortable shave, but very expensive and should have been better.<BR>FOLLOW-UP: 1 WEEK<BR>My mistake - I guess the battery IS L-ion instead of Ni-Cd. Don't know where I thought I got the bad info. Oh well. Still, the point is even MORE important in that case; this system seems to be buggy. Surely somebody at Philips knows enough about battery tech to have helped the shaver division do better than this! If not, should have got a bit of help from Nokia. Out of all the cameras, camcorders, cell phones, Palms, computers etc. that I use that have L-ion batteries, this is the \\"shakiest.\\" I'll post again to follow up on the \\"conditioning\\" cycle I tried. So far it seems to be working better.<br />FIRST REVIEW<BR>I have used various Norelco rechargable triple header shavers for the last 30+ years. I have been impressed that each model I purchased has been an improvement over the previous one. Well, maybe that isn't the case this time. My last shaver was a 5885 XL that I have used more than three years. It was getting pretty \\"tired\\" and I was looking forward to an upgrade. Hmmm.<br />THE GOOD NEWS<br />SHAVING EXPERIENCE - this is the best shaving machine of any type I have every used. I can shave as close as diligent effort with a good blade razor. I think the little holes in the head along with the familiar slots make a big difference. You have to go slowly to get really close, but it is comfortable and does a great job. Top notch performance from the head system.<br />CLEANING- the ability to clean the razor under the faucet is a big plus. I open the head and rinse under hot tap water after every use, then leave the head open and let it air dry. I disassembled the heads once for more thorough cleaning. I expect once a month would be plenty often for this since you can do a quick, easy clean every day. This really is a nice feature, and I suspect it keeps the cutters working better, too.<br />NOT MADE IN CHINA!<br />THE BAD NEWS:<br />BATTERY!<BR>I charged overnignt before first use. First few charges, I only got about 20 minutes shaving before the machine shut down. When applying a little extra cutting pressure, the shaver would unexpectedly stop, and the \\"minutes left\\" readout would go to zero. This happened several times. Plugging in may or may not get you any more shaving. Last time it did this, I recharged fully, then with the head open, let the motor run for about 2 hours until the battery was fairly well (I assume) discharged. Then, I fully recharged it. I hope this \\"conditions\\" the NiCd battery. So far it seems to be working better. Still, this is pretty sad for a shaver in this price range. For the money  Norelco gets for this thing, it should have intelligent L-ion battery technology in it! <br />HANDLE ERGONOMICS<BR>Not bad, but a step backwards from the 5885.<br />FANCY DISPLAY?<BR>Who sold who a bill of goods on this deal? There is no more information than on pevious models; it is in a less usable format (minutes remaining instead of shaves remaining) and you have TO TURN THE SHAVER ON to see the current charge status. The stupid display is blank until you run the shaver. On previous LCD models, you could ALWAYS read the display. If Norelco REALLLY REALLY thinks they need to use this LED display, at least put a button on the shaver to turn on the display without having to run the shaver! This is dimbulb design of the first order.<br />CHARGING<BR>Past models didn't need a \\"wall wart\\" charger. They directly plugged into a range of voltages etc. without any kind of wall transformer/power converter dealie. This was nice since all older Norelco cords worked and they were not special. The new \\"James Bond\\" shaver is a big step backwards since it now has a \\"wall wart.\\" I expect there is actually a good reason for this; the wash out under the faucet feature probably requires low voltage to the shaver head rather than line voltage. If that is the case, it is worth the trade off, I guess. Still, the older system was more convenient.<br />SUMMARY/RECOMMENDATION:<BR>Shaving heads are great. The rest of the machine is not Norelco's best effort. Buy the cheapest shaver that incorporates the Norelco SPECTRA heads and save your money on the \\"100\\" minute batteries and the lame readout.	2004-01-05

First of all, I wonder about the name \\"Spectra\\". All your fans know, that Roger Moore got rid of Spectra and its vicious leader, Mr. Bluefeld, about 30 years ago. So how come we meet it again today as one of your gadgets? I know. You'll say it's nothing, and you'll probably be right. But the name is a symbol to my main argue, that 8894 is nothing but an old machine pretending to be new.<BR>It's a good shaver, but it doesn't give you the right value for price. I have a 10 yrs. old Norelco 5584XL, that offers more or less the same digital functions of 8894's LCD, and does a good work on my face. Of course,  the 8894XL's battery is better, and gives about 30 minutes more of shaving, before recharging it, the designing is more up to date,and you can wash it with water, unlike the older generations. But the 5584XL, looks nice and elegant even today, it's most reliable, and works almost as new. The problem, 007, was, that I tried the 8894XL for few days and did not feel much improvement comparing to the 5584, that can justify spending so much money on it.<BR> I don't know Braun or Remington last models, but in my opinion, if 8894 is Philips/Norelco's best shot, their shaving machine division has reached its moment of truth. <BR>So, Mr. Bond, these are the reasons for not buying your shaving weapon: it looks new, it costs new, but it doesn't work as new.<BR>P.S. If you think about selling your old silver Aston Martin by the price of your shaving machine, please let me know.	2004-01-05

I've had one for 2 years now and use it even on trips. Works great for keeping your teeth white and plaque-free.  Pretty good product overall- the ultrasonic cleaning seems to clean well and helps keep you from wailing on your gums too much.  Actually, I think a lot of the worth of this thing is in the timer- it encourages you to brush for a full two minutes and reminds you every 30 secs to move on to the next area. <BR>Problems: Reliability- I have yet to wear out a head since the plastic base has broken on every one long before the head needed replacing. That can get expensive at about $14/head every three month or so. Now even the base unit has cracked. I think the vibration from the heads must really be hard on the plastic they use. These should be beefed up or changed to somthing more durable. But even with the low reliability, I'm still buying another one. Just be warned- they work great but these things are expensive to buy and maintain. But then again, aren't your teeth worth it?	2004-01-04

While it took a couple of shaves for my skin to get used to this shaver, even though I have always shaved with an electric, it was well worth it. This shaver is great, it's relativly fast, and oh-so-close. <br />However, I am not so keen on the shave on the neck and chin. On the chin it feels smooth but upon closer examination it is apparent that the shave isn't as close as it is on the rest of the face. On the neck I get irritated and that just makes it so much harder to get a close shave the following day; it could get painful come Wednesday. <br />And the ease of cleaning the shaver under in water is priceless.  <br />I am also very impressed with the battery life. <br />My one gripe is the conditioner. Don't get me wrong it helps the shave very smooth and reduces friction that would increase irritation, BUT it is 90% alcohol, which is not very good for the skin; it realy dries it out. Additional, the dispenser is not consistant. My biggest problem was constantly buying additional cartridges (they don't last long) and it seemed that the lotion dispenser never worked so well after giving the shaver a through cleaning. To avoid all of these issues I now use a third party preshave (Jack Black - great stuff) and enjoy the close shave of the freeglider without the lotion. <br />Overall the shaver gives a close shave and the lotion hekps reduce friction, but I just don't think the lotion is worth the hassle or cost.	2003-12-30

(If a good razor gets him to shave, I am all for it.) Many men have sensitive skin and an adjustable blade means that they can get a comfortable shave --a big plus here at home. The heads are washable, and over time, if they need replacement, the top flips out and the elements can be replaced with new. The charge lasts long enough for trips away from home for several weeks without bringing a charger. What more could you want? It's worth every penny.	2003-12-30

I received another razor for Christmas - a rotary with an automated cleaning feature.  Hated it.  After the first shave I had skin irritation.  Then cleaning it was a total waste - one shave and the thing ran for 10 minutes in its base cleaning stand - supposedly you were supposed to do this every day and change the solution $12 every month.  <br />I returned it for the Braun and boy am I happy.  great close shave - no irritation - and it cleans with water or by simply brushing it out.  Very Very good.  I highly recommend this - as close a a blade without the fuss.  Braun has made me a believer.	2003-12-29

Though this is one of the models in the \\"lower\\" groups of Norelco's offerings, it has more than enough bells and whistles.  I really can't see why anyone would need more.  My first shave with this razor ended with the best shave I have ever had in my life.  Just read on and follow all the suggested steps.<br />Norelco instructs us that all razors of this model should be fully charged for 4 hours before the first shave. I believe that all of Norelco's razors are given if not a full charge, a partial charge.  The manual also explains about the LED lights that indicate the percentage of charged power available to the razor.  When I plugged my razor in for charging, before using, it said 40% available and the 60% indicator was blinking (meaning not quite 60% full).  Give the razor a full 4 hour charge, even if the LEDs say 100% in about 1 hour or so.  Go the full 4 miles the first time around (remember, this razor has a quick charge function, so it may appear to be fully charged, it isn't, it's just your quick charge at work).  I washed my face with plenty of soap and soaked my whiskers with a lot of water.  Then I dried my face completely.  Then, contrary to what Norelco says, I used a liquid preshave conditioner.  Not a gel, not a powder (which should never be done with these razors), simply a liquid.  Then I shaved - - - and it was the best shaving experience I have ever had.<br />The LED lights tell me everything I need to know - - 20%, 40%, on up to 100% power available.  It starts blinking red at 20% power left.  You can still shave; it's just letting you know that you need to charge it up.  It does have the sideburn trimmer, which I have used and it performed wonderfully for me.<br />If this is the \\"lower\\" line, I don't know what you can do with the higher lines.  I do not see any need for something beyond this razor.  It has its cleaning brush for the razor heads, it has its charging cord, it has its neat little traveling pouch that holds the razor and all its accessories.  What more do you need?<br />It feels comfortable and well balanced in my hand, it is very quiet, and it is a pleasant razor to look at.  For the price, you cannot possibly go wrong.	2003-12-28

It is also not as gentle on your skin.  On the plus side, it is fast.  It is nearly deafening when shaving near your ears.  The battery indicator is a joke.  It is so dim that you cannot see it unless in the dark, and it's indication of charge is not related to the amount of juice left.  The linear system uses some kind of internal inverter, so it doesn't slow down when the batteries wear out.  It just stops right in the middle of your shave.  It then takes 12 hours to charge.  You can maybe finish your shave after an hour charging, but you're late for work!  Keep your old shaver around for when this happens (often).  The final reason for the low score is the durability.  The seals are not too good and thus the contacts inside get corroded.  I have taken mine apart several times to clean the battery contacts and ultimately solder them.  Because of the corrosion problem, all bets are off as to whether it is charging at all or how much charge you'll have left at any given moment.  Finally, the pop-up works sometimes and sometimes not.  2 days ago, it finally went.  That's why I'm surfing Amazon.  This shaver only lasted me less than 2 years which is not good considering its price.  My Braun (which still works) is 15 years old.	2003-12-27

Not a close shave at all, even after using it for a month. Even older, lower Norelco models shave better. Battery life is tremendous -- but who needs 100 minutes worth of shaving without charging? The only difference between sensitivity levels is how much it hurts -- takes the same amount of time, no closer shave. Washes well, but built in sensor is useless. My next shaver will be the Panasonic ES8092NC. Will try out and post after a month or so. Bon voyage.	2003-12-19

I have definitely noticed that the static electricity during the dry winter months is much less.  I am very happy with mine and am going to buy a second one as a gift.

I am a rotating head shaver kind of guy and have been using Philips/Norelco products for years. I bought this one after the battery died (again) in my last one and am very happy with it. It is much quieter than my last shaver and the shave is better. The key reason to get this one is the fact that it has a lithium ion battery which should last longer (less memory effect) than the nickel hydride stuff in the less expensive shavers. If you want a very good rotating shaver this is the one for you.	2003-12-16

We used the two units as recommended, and the cleaning and ease of use was excellent.  <br />We also have a 2.5 year old son, and he sometimes he likes using the Sonicare.  It was great while he was teething.  Now he is very interested in normal brushes, but still uses it once in a while.<br />My only hesitation in recommending these units is their reliability.  When I bought this thing I mistakenly thought the base would last for 5-10 years.  Well, ours just died the other day and its beyond the 2 year warranty.  Sonicare has a nice website where you can get warranty information and send email back and forth to customer service.  However, once we determined it was beyond the warranty period, they were of little help.  The offered to sell me another unit-- they claimed it was at a discounted price, but it is more expensive than Costco or Bed Bath and Beyond.  When I asked them to meet or better that price, they said that would be bad business practice.  I guess I don't understand their business model because I am now considering Oral B and Braun.	2003-12-16

Although certain areas of my face were easy to cut, I just couldn't get the shaver to  get the short hairs on my chin and neck.  I would spend at least five minutes on those areas alone.  Thinking it was just a face thing and that, eventually my skin would adjust, I carried on past the trial period until well over a month of use.  Finally, I gave up, took the shaver back, and tried the Norelco Quadra.  What a difference!  The Quadra took to my skin immediately and within two days, I was getting almost every hair that the BSS wasn't.  So now I'm a faithful Norelco fan.   Sometimes we fall in love with technology at the expense of the quality of the shave.  I learned my lesson.	2003-12-14

The Lumiscope blood pressure monitor reports your systolic and diastolic pressure as well as your heart rate.<br />I got this for my family members to help keep track of their blood pressure as we maintained our low carb lifestyle, and we found it VERY easy to use. In fact, we leave it in our kitchen and whenever people come to visit, they pick it up and play with it, without needing any instruction manual at all. You hold it in your left hand, with your finger in the cuff. You slide the slider until it's snug. You hit the ON button and then you hit START. That's it!<br />It's smaller than a paperback book, and can sit out on a counter or shelf, easy to grab and use at any time. Anyone who visits your house can give it a try and see what their own values are without any effort at all.<br />A number of people who have visited us have tried it and it's worked for everyone. I suppose if you had a REALLY thin finger it might not fit snugly enough, but we have had a number of thin, athletic people use it without any trouble at all. <br />Because it's just on your finger, there's no worry about rolling up arm sleeves or dealing with clothing at all.

You definitely know why they call it anti-gravity. Though the massage feature doesnt really hit everywhere exactly as targeted and the actual strength of the top setting of the massage is not hard enough to feel like you had a massage, it is pleasant and the heat feature is wonderful. Not to hot yet very soothing. My one concern is the thickness of the pad. It isnt very plush and you can feel the hardness of the &quot;motors&quot; through the padding. And I have had it for less than 2 weeks which is not long enough to wear it thinner. Though the anti-gravity chair looks great it was hard to put together. You need two people. All in all I am satisfied with it for its stated purpose. I dont think I could use it as a regular chair though. The price is very high for the quality. Look around before you buy.	2003-12-11

Luckily, I was able to avoid it for the first 26 years of life, even during basic training at Ft. Benning, where running a disposable blade across my face was little more than an exercise in nicking and forestalling the wraith of a drill sergeant.  Sadly, over the past few years I've reached the point where shaving every day is a necessity, and God knows how much money I've pissed away on Mach III cartridges over the past couple of years.<br />I guess complaining about the Mach III is poor form, since it's the best razor (by far) in the history of mankind.  That said, I've found that each razor is good for one burn-free shave, which winds up costing a lot of dough to keep in the medicine cabinet.<br />Which is why the Panasonic kicks ass.  It gives as good a shave as the Mach III without ANY of the associated skin irritation, thanks in large part to it's ability to cut through shaving cream and water (i.e. it can be used in the shower).  It's a snap to clean, and has a computerized readout of the remaining battery charge.  Buy it without any hesitation.	2003-12-09

I'm going to start out by saying that this IS a good product. It has acquired some poor reviews, but in my opinion reviewers expectations might have been a bit high. This IS a machine; it is not a direct replacement for your better half rubbing your feet nor does it do miracle work. After reading many many reviews they all seem to have the same conditions. Yes it does make noise not excessive like many suggest and certainly not as loud as a vacuum cleaner.<br />The noise in our home was not a concern and was able to be overlooked. Any machine which makes bubbles needs a pump; pumps are not silent and if you find a silent one you are for sure in a different price range.<br />We filled our unit to the max line and used it with the roller attachments and did move our feet around while in bubble mode. This unit uses water and if you think you're not going to get a drop on the floor your nuts.  We used a towel underneath the unit and all \\"flood\\" worries were gone away.<br />The incorporated water heater does an excellent job at keeping hot water hot and warm water warm, if your intentions are to use this machine to heat up your water for tea or coffee you'll be disappointed. We filled the machine with hot water and turned everything on including bubbles, after 10 - 15 minutes there was no noticeable drop in water temperature nor was an increase in temperature felt. If you are using HOT water the infrared heater seams negligible. Maybe it does more if your feet aren't so hot to begin with.<br />As mentioned before, water splashing, noise, and not so great heaters plague all of these \\"foot spa\\" type machines. I would have given this a 4.5 star rating but gave it 5 because it doesn't deserve all the previous bad reviews. IT IS A MACHINE PEOPLE! And costs less than one good family dinner out, stop being so picky and just enjoy it. And no I am not on the sales marketing team. :-)<br />Michael	2003-12-08

There was no stopping it until I finally had to disassemble it completely and took it outside to the trash. Shame on Homedics for selling this awful product which obviously was never tested.

I have two boys age 2 and 4 and have gotten A LOT of use out of ours over the past 4 years. Very reliable, useful and durable. It is great to be able to get the same reading as a rectal (the only reading doctors ask for) without the hassle of actually taking it rectally. Or trying to keep track of what different readings mean depending on how you took them (underarm, oral, rectal). As for the folks who have a problem getting an accurate reading -- 1) you just need to make sure you get it in the ear correctly (not difficult) and 2) I take the highest of three readings (which takes seconds). I mean, as a mom and not a doctor, I just need to know if its 101,2 or 3 and whether its going up or going down.

Well, those standards must have changed over the years.  I bought this as an emergency replacement while I'm getting my 6525 fixed, what a difference.

I bought it to replace another BP-monitor (which was ruined by my dog who chewed on the cuff). Both models are  upper-arm-style blood pressure monitors.  Both models are accurate (with about 5 to 10 points difference from readings taken at my doctor's office). This unit and the one it replaced both include auto-off and memory recall features.  The older model could only store 2 readings while this Lumiscope model can store the last 60 readings sequentially. This Lumiscope model is also more gentle because this model measures on inflation.  My older BP monitor measured on deflation; it routinely applied pressure 100- to 150-points above my true blood pressure levels before it began the measurement process.<br />This Lumiscope model is a good BP monitor to have around the house.	2003-12-03

I have very sensitive skin so going to a blade was a hard decision but I tried the Mach 3 turbo. As far as blades go they aren't bad and give a close shave but for my sensitive skin no way. Not to mention they get a little pricy as people know who use the Mach 3. Then I tried the Norelco and I never looked back. 1) close shave 2) no irritation 3) extremely easy to clean 4) initial cost may seem high but in long run saves alot of money 5) not that it matters much but looks very stylish.

I've used this model for about a year, and it's sold me on using electic razors over regular razors (which I used for over 30 years).  <br />The shave is very smooth, but it takes a long time on my beard.  I have to go over the same spots many times.  It takes me about 15 minutes to really do a good job.  I don't know if a rotary, or higher-priced foil, razor would speed this up.  Maybe my beard is heavier than most, or I'm too picky, or I need a heavier-duty shaver (this one seems rather light-weight).  Or, for all I know, it takes everyone 15 minutes to shave with an electric razor.  I just don't know.  But once I'm done, my face and neck are quite smooth.<br />The rechargable battery lasts a long time, and it recharges very quickly.  The smaller size of the shaver is handy.  I agree that the trimmer is useless, but I don't really need it anyway (I use a smaller hair trimmer for that).  <br />I'll search for one that works quicker, but I'm quite glad someone gave this to me last Christmas so that I could investigate using electric razors.  Quite happy with it.	2003-11-29

With no need to change heads every 3-4 times this razor will pay for itself vs. those blades that keep getting more expensive.<BR><br />They are right though, the electric razor will need a minimum of 2 weeks to get used to your face properly before you will get its full effect.  But give it a try, if you can sacrifice some closeness of your shave for lots of extra comfort, this electric razor is well worth it!	2003-11-19

For the first year it worked terrifically, having accuracy even the doctors were amazed at.  Shortly after having it for one year, the machine broke down.  Sent it to Lumiscope for repair but since it was a few months out of warranty had to pay for the repair.  Think it was $20.  The machine worked for a few months thereafter and then again broke.  Sent it a second time to Lumiscope; again a repair charge.  About 6 months later, it finally gave out and I threw it out.  So the machine which cost me originally $79 plus some $40 for repair, actually cost almost $120 for less than two years of usage.	2003-11-15

High quality plastic.<br />Only slight negative is the power could be a tad better on battery. But still far more powerful than any other cordless trimmer I have tried.<br />Best value.

I usually take 2 or 3 readings and trust the highest one.  You just have to pay attention to see when it has wax on the cover so you can change the cover.

I really don't care much for the body fat percentage feature.  It reminds me of a blood pressure watch I used to have.  It varies so much that I'm not sure its really measuring anything.  Plus, body fat is something that really doesn't change to any appreciable level daily, you'd need months to get any real percentage changes!  I got this product to be a good scale, and it is.  The kick buttons are nice initialize the scale, and to see previous weight. If you don't have a big family, you can use two or more (of the five) positions and track your weight loss (or gain) over a longer time.  <br />My last scale from a famous company (which makes a huge number of scales) was bought just over a year ago.  For some reason it started weighing everyone 22 pounds less after a couple of weeks.  There were no adjustments and settings to change or compensate, it was just automatic.  I even called the company and they couldn't give me an answer.  Just before I bought the Tanita, I found out.  The scale calculated its weights based on inputs from the four legs which were suspended on pins.  Early on, the scale must have had the plastic bushing damaged on one of the legs. It probably happened just by dragging the scale to use it on the floor.  I found out only after the leg finally fell off.  It could not be put on, and I had to trash my expensive scale.<br />In constast, the Tanita is a well made scale which does not depend on external feet to calculate a weight.  I bought this particular version so to get a solid piece of equipment.  Most companies cheapen the construction of the lower cost models and they don't hold up.  The extra features are nice even if I don't make use of them all.  Out of the box it is indeed, a solid, well made instrument, I can believe it will hold up much longer than my last scale.	2003-11-02

I get headaches behind my eyes a lot, and to tell you the truth the soft movement, and pressure of this brush sooth the headache away, while giving me a great smile! My teeth feel so smooth right now. It truly gives you the dentist clean feeling but better, because you didn't actually have to go and sit in a chair for 20 minutes with your mouth wide to the world!

I like how it looks different from most of the other straighteners out there. The design is nice, colorful, and modern. Aesthetics may not be too high on your priorities for a straightener, but it's a good bonus.

The Norelco was great, but suddenly stopped working. I was looking for a replacement when I came across the Braun and decided to give it a try.<BR>Compared to a regular razor, even those with 2 or 3 blades, the Braun is great. It's fast, easy to use, and provides a close, comfortable shave. For people used to regular razors, this shaver could be rated a 5.<BR>Based on my previous experience with the Norelco, however, I have to be less lenient. The Braun was more expensive, yet the Norelco provided closer shaves in less time. With the Braun I always find some hairs that the shaver missed. It doesn't matter in which direction I shave, the Braun fails to pick some hairs. This happens in different parts of my face, cheeks, neck, etc. When time came to replace the foil I expected some improvement, but none was noticeable. In contrast, replacing the Norelco heads yielded a very noticeable change.<BR>Other negative aspects include the expense of the cleaning cartridges, although I do like the cleaning system. <BR>Also, after a few months of normal use, the Clean and Charge stand stopped making the right &quot;contact&quot; with the shaver, so now I have to press a couple of time to get it to work properly.<BR>Overall, I am happy with my purchase, but I think that it should have been better for the money. At the same time I got this, my brother in law got a Norelco similar to the one I had, but with more options like a skin lubricant dispenser, wet &amp; dry use, etc. He also used to have the 5885 XL, and loved it, yet  he was very disappointed with his new Norelco. Maybe we both were spoiled by the 5885 XL.<BR>Even though my Braun works fine, I have decided to look for another shaver. It is good, but not great, especially for the money.	2003-10-14

After the Remington I had for several years no longer worked, instead of buying a replacement, I decided to try something new and purchased the Braun 5414. I've been using this razor for over two years now and it works far better than my old Remington ever did. My shave is as close to the skin as it can get without cutting and in some places on my face, I think the razor actually cuts below the surface without leaving a nick. Should you chose to begin using this razor, give it about a week to get used too, especially if you've been using a different brand of razor. Also, if you have highly sensitive skin, the Braun 5414 might be too rough for your face. Other than that, I highly recommend it.	2003-10-09

I thought I would replace it with a body fat analyzer/scale to get a better picture of my fitness progress. Was I ever disappointed! First off, I don't think it is humanly possible to make it more complicated to get the BFA reading. But more important than that, after about six tries, I only got it to give me a BFA reading ONCE, could never get it to store my information so it didn't ask to re-enter it every time I turned it on AND on top of that, the button that you are supposed to push to move from the weighing to the BFA mode completely quit working. Obiouvsly, it is NOT well-made. The instructions said to hold the button in for two seconds when you turn it on and the scale will go into memory mode. What a joke--I barely pressed on the button and it seemed to go crooked in its housing, as if broken. Certainly, it didn't break from the light touch I gave it, so it was obviously made poorly. After that, it pretty much refused to go on. Finally, it came back on once more, gave me my BFA reading and went off, never to come on again. I would agree with the first reviewer--by the Tanita brand and skip this cheap, inaccurate, frustrating scale. You will be glad you never got it.	2003-10-09

I have high blood pressure and after the birth of my daughter, another medical condition necessitated the care of a home health care nurse.  One nurse used this monitor, another a wrist monitor, another an automatic arm monitor.  Amazingly, it was the finger monitor that consistantly proved itself the most accurate when compared with manual arm cuff readings.  The wrist was the absolute worst.  Even the automatic arm cuff was off by at least 10 pts. everytime.  This could be due to the fact that I am a large boned, heavier person and the other monitors tended to barely fit.  Because of this, I would recommend this monitor especially for those in the same situation.  I only feel comfortable recommending this monitor because of its consistant performance compared to everything else.  I can't explain others' experiences.  I can only say that I feel extremely comfortable using this machine to monitor my high blood pressure at home.  And I am awfully picky!	2003-10-06

I checked with my pediatrician today just to be sure that ultrasonic nebulizers are as effective as compressor nebs--she confirmed that studies show them to be more effective because the smaller particles reach deeper in the lungs...I would highly recommend this nebulizer.

It is not loud.  The bubbles and the massager do make noise - but less than a foot bath at a salon.  If you turn on the spinners on top, there is additional noise, but I don't feel like it is an unreasonable amount.  Additionally, it was a lot lighter than I expected even with water.  When I first used the spinners, they tickled my feet and I thought they were too rough.  However, after soaking for a little while, I found that I could use the spinners without experiencing extreme sensitivity.  Basically, I like this product and have used it more than once.  (A good sign.)  I did not give it five stars, because a salon soak and pedicure is still a better experience.	2003-09-26

I've always had sensitive skin and my Dad had been using a Norelco model that was good but not adjustable (a dermatologist recommended that I use a razor that could be adjusted).  <br />That made sense to me.<br />So, with it on sale and all the other offers, I bought it.  Undoutedly, the most expensive razor I have ever purchased.<br />Now several months have passed and I can say that I love it.  With the dial on the 'sensitive' setting (all the way to the S), it does a fine job in terms of shaving close, but leaves no razor burn.  It is comfortable to hold.  Only very rarely does it pull a hair.  It can handle several days of stubble without complaint.  <br />And the battery?  Shaving several times a week I can go an entire month without recharging.  <br />The sideburn trimmer is well made but it is just that, a trimmer.  Don't expect it to shave your head.  <br />The ability to rinse the heads under water is great.  Easy cleaning!<br />I highly recommend this razor.  I believe that it will continue to provide years of close yet comfortable shaving.  Despite the price, it has proven an excellent investment.	2003-09-22

I have tried many electric razors over the years, always with two goals in mind.  1. A better shave. 2. Ease of use.<BR>This had NEITHER, I get a better shave from a month old 20 cent disposable razor.  <BR>I chose this model based on several good reviews, as well as the 60 day money back full satisfaction guarantee.  I anxiously awaited the arrival, and was hopeful that I had finally found a razor I would like, boy was I wrong.  I was pleasently surprised with the overall look and feel of the razor, as well as the pivoting features of the heads.  I followed the instructions as to the charging, of course needing to wait several hours before I could try it.<br />The first attempt at shaving was so so.  I figured I just needed to try it out and get used to it, but I was concerned about the fact that it only got about half the hair, and the half it got wasn't even as smooth as with a disposable.  so I tried it again several times over the following week.  Not only did it not shave near as close as a disposable, but it hurt like all get out.  I do have a very rough beard, but I do not have sensitive skin by any means.  I had to press and pull and tug and twist and grind to a point of severe irritation.  And with all that, I would have been ok perhaps, because I could do it sitting in my livingroom (the clipping catcher works great) and shaving with a regular razor often causes me bad razor burn.  But after grinding and grinding away at the same spot from every angle, I was stil left with the equivelent of about 8 hours growth after a blade, that just rough to the touch feeling, not quite the look of a 5 O'clock shadow, but close to the feel.<br />So I called them up about the money back guarantee, thouroughly unsatisfied.  well, they will give me the cost of the razor back.  I figured the cost of shipping was gone, but here is the catch;  you have to send it back INSURED, PREPAID.  MORE money you get duped out of for a worthless product.  Ok, while I think they should pay for the return shipping, I can ignore that, but now I have to wait 6 weeks AFTER THEY GET IT for them to mail me a check.  I am thinking it will be about 8 weeks after I send it before I will see my money.  Of course that is for the purchase price, the 30 some odd dollars it will cost for shipping both ways is just plain gone. Maybe I should have just spent a couple hundred, cause if the next one I try is as useless, that is how much I will be out of anyhow, between the cost of a razor and the shipping to play the money back games.	2003-09-20

I have tried various electric razors and generally I am left unsatisfied. Then about a year ago I came across the Norelco 6735 Advantage razor and I am happy to report that I have found the closest thing to a perfect electric razor. The Norelco does very well with daily shaves but doesn't do well against multiple day growth. If I go more than a day without shaving, I'll use a blade to get the close shave. I don't know anything about the mirror since that was not available when I made my original purchase but the razor itself is very good. After 1 year's use, I am still using the same blades that originally came with the razor and it is still shaving as close as when I purchased it. The gels are good though I feel they are somewhat expensive. I will be purchasing 3 more of these razors for my 3 sons this Christmas and believe me, if I wasn't satisified with this razor, that wouldn't be happening.	2003-09-17

I have a terrible gag reflex which makes going to the dentist a royal pain in the you-know-what. After cracking a tooth that I had a root canal in 12 years ago, I bought this toothbrush. <br />The difference was amazing. My teeth got whiter and stayed whiter. I ended up having to have oral surgery to remove the busted root canal tooth, but while I was under all the drugs I wanted them to clean my teeth and fill all my cavities. <br />Well they didn't do that because my teeth were already clean and I didn't have any cavities. I had not been to the dentist prior to this in about 6 or 7 years. All they did was a minor cleaning and a flouride treatment and sent me on my way. Cool. <br />This toothbrush is a great part of what should be a 3 pronged attack to preserve your teeth. Brushing with this brush 2 to 3 times a day (after every time you eat is a good idea) in addition to regular flossing and using a good antiseptic mouthwash should keep your teeth in excellent shape. It will also keep you from suffering from gum disease as so many people do these days. <br />This toothbrush is a great investment in your dental health. Buying it is MUCH cheaper than having a dentist try to re-construct your mouth. Trust me. Having a single dental implant to replace that pulled tooth of mine is going to be a 5,000 dollar process. <br />If you have never used one before, they feel wierd. But after one week of consistent use, you will never go back. Ordinary toothbrushes feel like futility now. I would also reccomend using the smaller brush heads as they are easier to use than the larger. <br />The unit is a tad bulky, but from what I hear you can even put on one of the new elite heads which is a much trimmer affair. <br />I really love this brush and will only get a new one (a Sonicare Elite) when this one dies. You can't go wrong with this purchase...	2003-09-16

It shaves close, is easy to use, is easy to keep clean, and works both with the cord and without (some other rechargables won't work with the cord plugged in).<br />This last point is important because there is no such thing as a rechargable shaver battery that stays &quot;like new&quot; forever.  After a couple of years, they start holding their charge for less and less time, until ultimately after several years you pretty much have to recharge them every day.  At that point, you can just keep the thing plugged in all the time (when it's plugged in, it performs as if it has a full charge), OR you can replace the motor (which is expensive), OR you can just order a new one (That's what I've done.  Refurbished models can be found for less than the cost of a replacement screen and cutter.)	2003-09-07

It does a great job shaving my face and actually is much less irritating to my skin compared to my old corded Braun shaver. ...<br />...  The 5612 shaves pretty close, although a few passes are required to get that really \\"smooth\\" skin feeling.  It has a long hair trimmer sandwiched between the two foil blades.  This is great because you can run it over a pretty thick beard and it chops off the long hairs before shaving them close in 1 pass.  It also comes with a nice hard travel case so it is easy to pack.<br />The other thing I really like is being able to rinse it off under water when finished.  That saves me a lot of time compared to my old corded razor.  It was such a pain to brush it out all the time - the hairs would get all over the sink and then I had to clean the sink.  Now, I just run the razor under hot water for 30 secs and I'm good to go.<br />For the price, this has most features anyone would need.  I couldn't see spending over [a dollar amount]for a shaver.  This one has a nice \\"middle-of-the-road\\" price and gives a great shave.	2003-09-03
US	50774342	R3IVLR82IM8GQY	B000068PBK	964005415	Norelco 8865XL Spectra Shaving System	Personal_Care_Appliances	4	37	37	N	Y	Excellent, even for a blade-user	I bought this shaver a while ago, but I wanted to wait at least a month before writing my review, since it's supposed to take about that long before your face is used to an electric razor.<br />This is my first electric, and I was concerned going into it. I looked at the price of good standard blades, though, and saw how quickly an electric razor would pay for itself. I'll never go back. For the first week, the shave was not as close as I had become accustomed with using a blade. After that, though, I've gotten closer and closer shaves by the week. After a little more than a month of using the Spectra, my skin is now smooth even against the grain. I've gotten back to where I was with a blade.<br />The Pros:<BR>- Shaving takes easily only half the time as it did with a straight razor.<BR>- I can shave any time, any where. With a blade, if I tried to shave more than once per day, I'd cut myself all up into a bloody mess. With this electric, I do notice some discomfort after having shaved a second time in a day, but it gets a nice close shave. A little after shave takes care of the sting, and I'm good to go again.<BR>- No mess. I really don't miss having to use shaving cream, even my nifty hot-lather shaving cream.<br />The Cons:<BR>- Motor power seems to wind down a bit towards the end of the battery charge. It's not too bad, but it seems to take longer to shave at the end of the charge, and I don't want to charge it early for fear of damaging the battery.<BR>- This is really a minor quibble, but I thought I'd mention it: Since this razor rinses clean under tap water, what few bits of hair are still left over are sitting in water over night. Every time I use the razor, for the first minute of shaving, it smells very strongly of old, wet hair.<br />Tips:<BR>- Blade users: Apply less pressure than you're used to. I find I get a better shave when the razor is touching the skin firmly, noticibly, but not pressing in at all.<BR>- Rinse it out every day, and turn the faucetup high. If you let it go a couple days without rinsing, it's much harder to clean out. It only takes a couple seconds, so why not?<BR>- Shave daily. I find that if I let my beard get a little longer the shaver still does a pretty good job. However, there will always be a few hairs that grew too long, curling down, that are not lifted by the razor head. Just shave daily, when you only have stubble, to avoid this.<BR>- Get a makeup mirror! These little mirrors are concave, magnifying your face so you can see where you've missed more easily. I mounted mine to the wall, slightly below my chin. Now I can more easily see if I've shaved my neck well.	2003-09-02

It has 3 &quot;on&quot; settings.  The first setting is for general shaving...the head pivots.  The second locks the head at an angle so that it is easier to shave right above the upper lip and other places where you don't want the shaver head to pivot.  The third setting is for trimming sideburns.  I have trouble shaving right along and underneath the jawbone for some reason.  The quick charge is a nice feature...you can quickly charge up the shaver for a 5 minute shave.  It takes about an hour or so to charge up fully.  One negative comment is that the shaver is a bit noisy.	2003-08-26

In short order I had a replacement shaver. The Panasonic does a very good job wet or dry. I prefer using it wet,with my Colgate shaving cream. Clean-up is easy,you simply open the head and rinse with running water. Make sure to let it dry with the head open,as it says in the directions.The KEY to a good experience with this razor is to SHAVE EVERY DAY. If you are the type of person who shaves once or twice a week,you may find you really must work to get it close; However,shave every day and it just takes a minute or so. The neck area gives you the most trouble if you let it grow. The first time shaving with the Panasonic I had to use the beard trimmer to get the neck hairs close. Since then I just use the razor every day and the neck area is not a problem. The battery holds a very good charge,probably good enough for week of shaving.This razor shaves better than my rechargeable 3-headed Norleco,but the Norleco needs new heads. The cost of the replacement heads for the Norleco is more than the Panasonic cost. I may buy another of these Panasonic rechargeable razors for my brother's birthday present.	2003-08-23

I have owned several different types and brands but this was my first Remington.  I think possibly due to the larger cutting block area, this gave me the quickest shave I have ever had.  Of course putting the shaver on turbo helped a lot also.  It was a close and quick shave, even on the first time using it.  The turbo did drain the battery from 40 minutes to 20, but with the Nickel Metal Hydride battery, even the directions say you can plug it in all the time when not shaving, so who cares how much it drains the battery.  Easy to clean under warm water.  Even the long hair cutter works well.  Very pleased with this shaver.	2003-08-13

I always used Atra razors in my 8 years of shaving. However, I became lazy and figured there has to be an easier way to shave. Enter stage right, the Panasonic Linear Shaver. The shaver is astoundingly good. It took about 5 shaves for my skin to become accostomed to it. Now I reap the benefits. My time spent shaving has been cut in half. I can shave anywhere I want to, no need for a sink. In addition, I am able to dry shave so I do not need to waste my time or effort with water or creams, and washing them off. Finally, the shaver cuts the hair just as close as a blade. (If you stretch your face while shaving, and press down gently, the shaving will take care of any stubble you may have.)<br />In comparison with a razor, the shaver is more expensive. However, the convenience my new shaver provides is worth far more than the extra money spent.	2003-08-06

I shave my head, and don't like using a razor blade.  Though I've been using a fairly new Norelco shaver, the model 7866XL, it wasn't leaving my head quite smooth enough.  When I read about this shaver that works wet or dry and dispenses shaving gel, I thought I might as well give it a try.  I like the results; it cuts more closely and finally gives me the look I want.  The &quot;steam-free&quot; mirror is a joke though.  I put it up in the shower and it immediately clouded up.  It is useless.	2003-08-04

It's not real fast, but it sure is faster than getting out the razor and going through that routine.  I just use it dry and dump out the clippings every few days.  I wash it when it needs recharging (every 2 or 3 weeks).  It seem to cut a little closer if you use shaving gel, but it is not worth the hassle for me.  My sons have used it when they are home.

Two huge improvments in the newer model: One, the beard guide works much, much better than the fixed guide on the old model. Second, if you do find yourslef with a dead mattery one morning, you an just plug the trimmer in and it will run as it charges. Very handy. There are a number of other improvements as well, like the addition of the retracting moustache trimmer, that make it that much more convenient to use.<br />It's not perfect. Once I finish trimming with the guide, I usually have to snap it off and use the bare trimmer to taper the bottom of my beard at my neck. Those who trim more closely than I do won't have this problem. All in all, a good product and a good value.	2003-07-31

Plus, I could rock and lean a certain direction to get it to say whatever I wanted.<br /><br />So I bought the Tanita as a result of some researching online and reading the reviews here at Amazon.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the accuracy of the scale. It let me enter my personal data. Height was even to the half-inch (important - there's an extra half-inch to me, and doggone it, I'm gonna get credited for that when it comes to weighing time).<br /><br />To use the scale, you just bump the button with your toe (there are two buttons for two users), and step on when it's ready (there are instructions on this; don't step on until it's ready). Stand there for a bit while it does its thing, and then climb off. The readings (weight and fat) display for several seconds (good if you can't see your toes while you're on the scale).<br /><br />The Tanita confirmed I'm a blob, and I trust it. Its readings are consistent. Just be sure you measure your weight/fat at the same time every day. Females, you'll have some fluctuations periodically (pun, yes?), so it's best to record what the readings were and when.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this scale. Check out the other reviews - some claim to have had the water-type of body fat analysis in the same day and have found that the scale is very accurate. That's very reassuring.	2003-07-27

You can use it in the shower and the mirror that comes with it is awesome!  You just stick it on the shower wall and your set.  The &quot;goo&quot; that comes out does a good job for moving the razor around.  You get a close shave, but it's not as close as a blade.  Also you don't want to use this thing if you have not shaved for more than two days.  It's worth the money and it's great to keep in the shower.  My best suggestion is to use it only in the shower.  If you have time and money, use the Mach III.  You will get a closer, more comfortable shave.  I think it is a good complement to the Mach III.	2003-07-24

I purchased this toothbrush because I had an older Waterpik brush that was not 'sonic' but did an excellent job of cleaning my teeth.  This one is a failure.  Buy a Sonicare if clean teeth is your goal.  The tongue scraper and the rubber caps do good jobs - but - I can clean my own tongue.  And with a Sonicare, I don't need the rubber cap cleaner.

I had my RBES365 for a couple of years before I replaced it with a Braun Syncro (7635?) shaver.<br />The Panasonic did a decent job of shaving, and it had a couple nifty features that made it stand out.<br />1) The straight trimmer on the back works well on sideburns.  (The Braun has a curved trimmer, which makes it harder to trim sideburns accurately.)  The trimmer portion still gets used when my wife cuts my hair.<br />2) The wet/dry feature, combined with the hinged foil holder makes cleaning easy.  Just snap open the hinge and run it under the faucet.  A brush on the cutter once a week and you're done.  The wet/dry feature also comes in handy to trim chest hair in the shower.<br />3) The charger/stand (mine was different than pictured) meant that the shaver was always in it's charger when not in use, so I never had to actively think about charging it.<br />For the price, this shaver is excellent.	2003-07-17

I have purchased a Panasonic ES8026 (the best panas. in our country - I think it's the same, maybe the battery is another...) only yesterday and this morning I tried shaving with with a shaving gel - I never had so close shave even with my Mach 3 razor (which also left lots of bumps and cuts on my face). I had shaved with a small travel shaver before, and the difference is great. I have very sensitive skin and shaving was always a nightmare for me. But this shaver changed everything! It glides over my face very easily and leaves almost no irritation. Beautiful!	2003-07-17

I wasn't too excited, but I tried it anyways.  The 7885 takes way too long to shave, and seems to miss a lot of hair.  I am Asian, don't have much to shave to start with, so this is very disappointing.  It took over 5 min of shaving to get a point where I thought my face felt good.  This shaver does NOT irritate at all, which is a good thing, considering I have really sensitive skin.  Just for fun, I shaved my face again with my Braun Synchro, to my surprise, I heard cutting noise...  Apparently, the Braun can save even closer than the Norelco.  After a quick shave with the Braun Synchro, my face felt even more smooth.  I am not pro Braun per se, but it seems the Braun Synchro shaves way better.  One more thing, if you keep certain facial hair, like goatee, you will find the big head of the Norelco to be a problem, you can't get a precision shave, where as the Braun has a narrow rectangle shaving surface, is much easier to control.  I was always pretty neutral about Braun and Norelco, but now I clearly found the winner--Braun Synchro.	2003-07-17

I bought this massager as a gift for a friend who claimed he liked it but I think he was just being nice.  I however was a little dissapointed.  The platform is made of a hard plastic and not a soft rubber as I expected.  You should keep your socks on when using it.  As far as a 'massaging' experience, there really isn't one.  Its just a two speed platform vibrator which I admit, does ripple vigorously through your feet at either speed. The hot and cold features worked well but were not a selling point for me anyway.  I gave it 3 stars because it lacked the soft rubber platform and because it doesn't massage your feet but rather vibrates them.	2003-07-17

Buying this razor was one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.  Considering that a razor is something you use once every day, (okay, twice when I have a date!), you really should use one that gives you a smooth and comfortable shave.  This razor gives me the most comfortable shave I've ever had.  The heads just float.  They move to conform to every curve of my face, chin, and neck.  It cuts as smooth as a razor, but I don't have to layer my face in foam or worry about cuts.  It also shows you how much of a charge you have left, so it never runs out on me in mid-shave.  Be good to yourself. You deserve this razor!	2003-07-14

This is a very good shaver - except that it suddenly stops working, even when I follow the owner's manual religiously.  I bought my first one last fall, and after about 3 months, it stopped taking a charge.  The replacement lasted about 2 months before the same thing happened.  Now my current replacement shaver (#3) just quit on me with no notice, so I'll have to call Panasonic again to get my FOURTH shaver in about 8 months.  If this happened once, maybe twice, I'd chalk it up to bad luck.  But FOUR defective shavers? ...so I figure this has a design flaw or poor quality control.  By the way, my previous older model Panasonic wet-dry shaver worked just fine for over 2 years...  DON'T BUY THIS SHAVER!!!	2003-07-14

It was time once again to get a new shaver: I carefully dissected my old Norelco to see what battery type I needed to replace and the microscopic screws that they use in assembly didn't hang around long enough for me to put it back together.  Oh well...luckily I got this in my Gold Box with my \\"Amazon Quiz\\" balance for a piddling fourty-five, not too much more than what a battery and replacement blades would have run me for my old model.  I'm glad I trusted the reviews here, cause I got a steal.  Operation sounds a little fainter and higher pitched than my old model, I understand why some people thought it weak, but it performs like a champ.  One quibble I have with it is that my old shaver had adjustable height for the floating heads, I had it cranked all the way down and it seemed to shave closer than this new one, but not without a noticeablely harsher shave.  This one fits the bill.	2003-07-13

I received this product for my birthday and found the facial cleaning feature (brush)to be excellent.  It is very good at exfoliating that old dead skin.  However, the misting feature lasted for two days and then quit.  Instead of two sponge attachements, they included two massagers.  I found that the pore suctions attachments were not very effective, I guess my pores wheren't as clogged as I thought and you have to be very careful with them unless you want to create a hicky on your face.  I love the rechargable feature because it means that I don't have to constantly search for additional batteries.  On the whole I would recommend this to anyone who likes a nice clean face.	2003-07-12

Relatively quiet.  Good warranty.  Gets the tough areas (neck) quickly.  Can wet-clean it!<br />The not so good: Old-school charging system and NO smart-charging system (come on Norelco, get with it!!).  No rubber-grips.   Not enough extras or product for the price.<br />After my bad experience with Braun's expensive, non-performing shaver, I traded it for another Norelco.  My previous Norelco lasted me 6 years...why I tried Braun's I'll never know.<br />Once again, my Norelco is giving me a clean, and VERY close shave.  The new Spectra system seems to be a hybrid between old reflex and the quadra system.  Whatever it is, it works for me.<br />However, if Norelco wants to keep my business in the future they need to start adding better (smarter) functions to the razors and quit with the marketing ploys in their product line...stick to what works.  <br />Technology is sufficiently advanced that they can, could and SHOULD start making their shavers with smart-charging systems like Braun!!  And put rubber grips on the side of these things!!  Do you not realize that we need traction?<br />Also, packaging the same razor body style with or without LED is just silly, choose a style that works best and go with it. <br />Plus, for the price of this thing, they need to throw in a free set of replacement blades or even some lube-oil or something, and not just that cheap travel case.<br />Overall I am happy with the performance of the razor, I just wish Norelco would bring a few more percs to the table for the prices they charge.	2003-07-11

My beard is also very heavy, and the hairs are very tough.  On top of that, I have incredibly sensitive skin, to the degree that cheaper electric razors have caused me to bleed.  On the occasions that I've been shaved by a professional barber, I ended up bleeding.  That being said, it's incredibly hard for me to shave with any sort of razor without damaging my skin.  I've had several other electric razors, including a high end Braun and the best one Remington made, which isn't saying much.  This razor is by far the best with which I've ever had the chance to shave.  The worst thing that I can say is that it leaves my skin somewhat dry after a few shaves, but that means that I should moisturize more.  Being someone who has lived for many years at a time with a full beard, fashionable or not, because the alternative wasn't very promising, this Norelco is amazing.<br />I work in a high-end sales position, dealing with corporate executives, and even with my heavy, fast growing beard, using the sensitive setting on this razor, I get enough of a shave to look good for my client visits.  What the other reviewers have said here, in that you have to work with it for a few weeks for your beard to get adjusted to it, does seem to be true.  It comes with a 3 week money back guarantee, which means, to me, that there's nothing to lose.  The battery life is incredible, it's the easiest razor to clean that I've ever owned, and I can travel with it for a week without depleting the battery.  I love it, and just wish it had been produced 20 years ago!	2003-06-30

WOW, I am speechless. But since that is not a good thing when writing a review, I will try to be verbose instead. <br />I have very sensitive skin and because of this, shaving has always been a real chore. Even with the best manual razors from Gillette, the Mach 3 or even the Schick Protector and FX (both tripled bladed also), I could never achieve a close confortable shave. A couple of years ago I decided to give up the blade and try an electric razor. I did all my research and at that time, at least via Consumers Guides, EPINIONS, and other web sites the top of the line Panasonic got top reviews. So I bought one. Boy what a mistake that was for me. It never gave me a close shave and after about 18 months, of use, I had to repace the blade and foil which was about 50% of the cost and this lead me to my new NORELCO Advantage. <br />Wow, What a difference! The instructions stated it would take 3 weeks for the hair on my face to  get trained to the Norelco method, but not in my case. My first shave was PERFECT...Even those hard to reach places; like under your lips or below the adam's apple  came out hairless. I could never achieve results like this with the other razors, blade or electric. And although some might think that having the built in preshave is a gimmick, I like it, it is one less thing to pack when you are traveling, and its there in a pinch, without loosing your shaving momentum. And since I never plan on growing a beard or mustache, the multi beard controls of the other Norelcos did not appeal to me. So guys, if you have any fathers day money left over, I highly suggest giving your face a break and trying one.	2003-06-22

Based on the reviews I read here, I purchased the panasonic 8003 shaver. It arrived yesterday. I was a little skeptical of the claims that it would shave as close as a razor - even the Mach III's which I have been using. However, I tried the 8003 for the first time this morning and I'm amazed how smooth the shave is. If it's not the same as the Mach III's, I can't tell the difference - it's an amazing shaver ! Panasonic recomends using the shaver for 30 days before drawing any conclusions about it's performance. I've used it once and it's already outperformed all the Braun's and Remington's I've owned. I like it.	2003-06-18

There is a reason why this razor is priced so low:  the construction is about as cheap as you can get, to the point of being downright hazardous to use.  Within fifteen seconds on my first shave, one side of the screen ripped open a 1/4 inch gap, exposing the blades.  Making matters worse, when I sent it back to Amazon requesting a replacement, in case perhaps this was a fluke defect, they instead gave me a partial refund.  How convenient for them!  Panasonic gets to recondition it again, and Amazon can sell it to [someone].<br />Based on my experience with this shaver, and the lack of a second unit to see if maybe this was just a bad unit, and Amazon's handling of the matter, I recommend that you DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY, not to mention risk nicking up your face.	2003-06-17

Like the last reviewer, I have used it extensively throught the winter with no problems at all.  I also used it with the liquid vicks additive and it worked wonderfully.  The past few times when my daughter has been sick, so have I and it always seems my husband is out of town.  My point is that my daughter and I slept in the same room with this vaporizer running and I was amazed at how well it helped with my congestion and breathing.  I am a light sleeper and I have had no problems with noises being made by the vaporizer during the middle of the night.  I actually found the humming noise made by the machine slightly comforting.  <br />As some of the other reviewers have said, it is slightly difficult to dump out excess water and clean, but so is any other vaporizer out there on the market.  The effort it takes it well worth the hassle.<br />I also had to add salt to get proper vapor out of the machine.  It took me a few times of playing with it to get it right and I believe I had to add the full amount recommended by the directions to get a really good vapor.  The instructions are clear in the packaging.<br />My only concern with this product is the hot steam that is produced.  My daughter is 2 now and sleeping in a toddler bed and the thought of her getting up in the night and possibly knocking it over and getting burned is a fear of mine.  This however is not a fault of the product, just a fact.  I plan on buying the cool mist version from the same manuacturer for my daughters room and using this one for myself when I am ill.<br />Hope this helps you in making your decision.	2003-06-11

Barnum was right...	I shuddered after reading the glowing reviews of this overpriced razor. A new razor is like a new car...what man doesn't love it? The real test comes years later, when problems occur. As a Norelco user most of my life, I sprung for this gimmick. The initial shaves were incredible, but I remained skeptical. After the initial 2 1/2 hour charge, it ran and ran. In fact, the LED readout was inaccurate, as it merrily hummed away, long after it displayed zero minutes available. The nine setting dial is a true joke. What were they thinking here? Some intricate scientific approach to shaving? Any man just wants the closest shave possible, so I dialed it up to the max. After usage when the blades wear, every man will end up doing this anyway. Like any electric razor, it is only as good as the blades. The LED gimmicks on this soon grew old. I just wanted it to fire up and annihilate my whiskers. After two charges, the shaves got worse and I had to finish with a disposable razor to scrape away the missed stubble. The replacement blades are overpriced to coordinate with this &quot;exclusive James Bond&quot; razor. Norelco is laughing it's way to the bank, as men buy into this gimmick. I'm going back to a basic electric razor and buying several sets of replacement heads. That is the key to economical close shaves.	2003-06-10

Also, there was no indicator to tell whether or not it needed to be charged.<br />The differences I noticed with the Panasonic shaver over the Remington was the quality. Everything was put together very nicely, it was quiet, easy to handle and shaved pretty good.<BR>It doesn't shave quite as good as the remington does, and it takes me a while to achieve a good shave, but I think that is due to it only having two razors vs. three on the remington.<BR>The pop-up trimmmer works well, and so does the stray-hair trimmer in between the two razor blades.<BR>One more thing is that with all of the electric razors I've used, this one irritates my skin the least, while having sensitive skin, that is really important to me.<br />Final Note: For the price I got this shaver, [$] it really can NOT be beat.

Either hang it to dry in an inconspicuous place (closet or bathroom) or lay it flat with plenty of cross-curent air (draft). You should make the mistake to heat it in the gas dryer (or electric, for those futility subscribers who don't mind supporting dams & nuclear generators) and your size L will become a M. Unless your waist is 28 or 30 (in which case your size is Medium), do get the Large. No, the waistband is not too loose on the L (it won't 'walk'), and no, the pouch-and-strap assembly is not more generous on the L. Unless you actually like to constrict your equipment in an overly binding jockstrap (such as for bronco riding or crawling beneath barbed wire while under fire), this Ace wide-waistband supporter is a lot more comfortable to wear for hours at a stretch (such as a round-trip from school/home to the field or work-site and back, without changing into skivvies afterwards). Although the material is a blend which resembles cotton but is not, you won't find another brand out there these days that has as non-irritating a feel and as loose a pouch as this all-purpose Ace. There do exist silkier jocks (finer fabrics, seamless interiors), but those smoother models by other brands do not provide enough breathing room for the jewels. This Ace is not the perfect answer to the need to contain in comfort, yet it sure beats wearing jockey-style briefs (with or without fly), which don't yield enough room up front for adequate comfort. Rule #2: Swimmers should either opt for a narrow-waistband style meant for runners/joggers/swimmers OR ascertain that the drawstring of their jammers/gym-shorts keeps the rear of the waistband from appearing in the lower back area. This is not the fault of a defect with jocks (wide or narrow band), but with the inherent design of the support and one's anatomy). Rule #3: Drug mules should repent & retire; that said, this Ace and most jocks won't hold the contraband securely: for that one could perhaps consider Munsingwear's kangaroo-pouch fly briefs. Eat well, live long, be happy.uld perhaps consider Munsingwear's kangaroo-pouch fly briefs. Eat well, live long, be happy.	2003-06-07

Before this, I've been using Braun shavers (last one was 5416 or 5116, can't remember) for 10 years.  Because I use shaving powder, I always had to buy a new shaver every 12 to 18 months.  The powder voids the warrantee of the shaver because the powder gets inside the shaver.  So, I learned the hard way not to fix the shaver but simply buy a new one. I never tried a Remington but I bet it would have the problem as the Braun.<br />Two years ago, the technician at the Authorized Braun Dealer suggested I try the Panasonic wet/dry linear screen.  Best advice I've had.  First, since it's a wet shaver, it's impervious to the powder, it never could get inside the shaver's mechanics.  As a matter of fact, the shaver is so much faster, I don't need to use the powder anymore.  I seem to remember that Braun's speed was between 1500 to 3000 RPM but the linear shaver is up to 13000.  So not only it's impervious but also much smoother than the Braun.<br />Downside: the screen head doesn't swing like the Braun, so it's not as easy to shave around the chin.<br />I still recommend the wet/dry panasonic over all the others.	2003-05-31

The Reflex action model was a big step forward with it's pivoting head that allowed the shaver to reach the tight spaces. The Quadra allowed washing the head to add greatly to convenience but overall it was a step backwards because it could not handle the longer hairs of 2-4 day growth, forcing you to shave everyday or keep a blade and cream handy. The Spectra solves that and also solves all issues with past shavers into one super shaver. The spectra seems to do everything right.<br />Easier to clean<BR>More powerful<BR>More swivel to the pivoting head.<BR>Rugged quality and workmanship.<BR>And of course a closer, quicker and more comfortable shave.<br />This is the best shaver bar none for getting all the stubborn hairs on the neck and jawline area which is a big issue with foil type shavers. Frustrated foil users who are not satisfied  with loose hairs and rough stubble on the neck should look no further than the Spectra.<br />The only negative  is the curved design of the body which is even more pronounced than that of the Quadra. It will roll like a rolling pin on the counter  so take care to find a secure location to rest it after use or it will surely roll off and hit the floor.<br />Now is the time to throw away that blade. The Spectra will be your best friend in the morning.	2003-05-30

You have to be close enough to a plug in order to use it.  Second, since I am pregnant it is very heavy carrying the spa from the sink to a plug.  When I used it, it did make my feet feel good, but definiately not what I was expecting.  It just wasn't worth the effort.  My husband massages my feet and that feels 10 times better than this foot spa.  Also, it did not keep my warm water warm.  After about 10 min.

It was _almost_ as close as when I use a razor and shave \\"against the grain\\". Very good, and better than I expected even after reading the great reviews. I did have to stretch my skin in a few places to help it along, but all in all it was much less hassle than the razor.<br />I expect this will get even better once I become more familiar with using it, and my skin adjusts to it, and I use it in the shower with shaving foam. But I'd say it gave me a 9/10 performance just on the first outing.	2003-05-28

The self cleaning feature is designed for lazy people. I like it because the cleaning fluid lubricates the blades. Refills are five a pop and supposed to last 30 days. Lets see 5x12=60 Thats a new shaver a year. Heres what I do...and not out of cheapness either, after every shave pop the screen off and give it and the blades one good blow, pop screen back on. Every other time, clean it.<br />Every 6th time charge it. By blowing every shave and cleaning every other....... you get 90 days out of a fluid refill, not 30.<br />The base detects how much [stuff] is in the fluid, and when it gets too much ,forces you to change cartridges or it will not work.(clean) To make your batteries last an extra year.. once a month let them run down completely, then charge. Theres a difference between being cheap and throwing money away. I just get to buy more toys. Aint that whats its about? Closest shave ever? Not really, but fuctional enough to be worth it.

My previous scale was much more inconsistent and inaccurate even though it was a brand name electronic scale.<br />Second, the instructions indicate this scale is not intended for the body fat measurement of athletes - those who work out an average 1 hour a day or more. I guess most people who keep track their body fat also do some kind of sports. And I also guess you need a more expensive Tanita with sports mode if you work out regularly and want to know your actual body fat percentage. Athletes have significantly different tissue composition (more muscle) to that of sedentary people and this is why researchers and companies use a different formula to calculate their body fat percentage.	2003-05-27

This particular product caught my eye because of the price and the claim that it is easy to use.<BR>I did not find it easy to use at all. It is very hard to keep your mouth dry while applying the gel and you'll find that it just runs off with the saliva. Once I had \\"invented\\" a way to keep my mouth dry (by putting tissue paper under my tongue) I still didn't notice any whitening. I continued using it for a few days but gave up because my teeth weren't whitening at all. I recently purchased Crest Whitestrips and they are ten times better than Colgate Simply White Night. I am only half way through the treatment and my teeth are already noticeably whiter and they only cost a few dollars more. So take my advice, buy Crest Whitestrips instead of this poor product.	2003-05-27

After using the Norelco Quadra 7864XL (same as 7865 but the blue version sold at Costco) I thought that I wouldn't be able to find an electric shaver comparable to a razor. The 7864XL left short stubble on my face and neck regardless of the number of passes. The Norelco rather than cutting hairs under the skin level seemed to give a close trim which meant that the shave lasted only half the day. I was sick of shaving twice a day. <br />After seeing the reviews online on the ES8003W, I decided to purchase it at Outpost.com (for only $100, $9.50 for overnight delivery & same day shipping by midnight EST). I was amazed with the results from the first shave. Following Panasonic's recommendations, I used a thin layer of Gillete Shaving Foam and got a shave that was closer at the end of the day than Norelco's at the beggining, and with only minimal irritation (the irritation went away after a few days). I also found that after using a skin cleanser on my face, the shave became even closer. Now, I'm able to get a shave that lasts the entire day (and leaves your face feeling like a baby's but) and leaves little or no stubble even at the end of the day. I couldn't be happier with this product. It feels well built, and is extremely easy to clean (simply clean with water and soap). A light sensor also guarantees that the blades move at 13,000 RPM even when the battery is low. The NiMH batteries used by the Panasonic can also be recharged at any time, and can not be overcharged. Unfortunately, Norelco's Quadra line uses a NiCD battery with no overcharge protection, which also must be drained of battery life before it can be recharged.	2003-05-18

First, the zoom ring, because it's made of rubber, tends to attract hair like a magnet attracts metal. Cleaning hair off of there is a MAJOR pain!! It'd be a hell of a lot easier to clean if it was made of plastic. Secondly, the cleaning brush they include is too small, and its design ain't that ergonomic. And why does it take 10 hours to charge up? Of course, I guess the average person doesn't use a trimmer that often, so I'm thinking that won't be a big deal. Overall, though, this product works as advertised. If you just want to \\"get the job done\\", and could care less about all that fancy, high tech stuff, then you'll get your money's worth with this trimmer.	2003-05-17

After about 10 years, my Braun wouldn't hold a charge any more, so it was time for a new electric shaver. I thought the Norelco 3-head design looked good (the James Bond ads had nothing to do with it, I swear), so I put it on my wish list and received it as a gift.    It's adequate, but has some weaknesses. The first thing I noticed -- and this may sound odd -- is that the high-pitched whiny motor just makes it sound cheap. It's hard to believe anything that sounds so weak can actually cut a tough beard.    I've found that with less than two days beard (your mileage may vary, but mine grows pretty fast), it doesn't seem to do much. It seems like the cutting elements need a longer whisker to get hold of. So I had to go over and over my face, getting very irritated skin and not a very good shave.However, if I've gone a couple days without shaving, it does a very good job. Comfortable, and gives a close shave, without having to go over my face too many times. I guess it depends on how often you're going to use it, your beard type, etc.    Other good things -- it charges up quickly, holds enough of a charge to give several shaves, and all of the cut whiskers are held inside (very important if you have to shave away from a sink). The flip-up trimmer also works well, if you have a use for that sort of thing.    But I'd still be happier if it didn't have that screechy, whiny motor sound.    An update, almost four years later... I'm actually even happier with the product now than when I first wrote the review. It's my main shaver now (I hardly ever take the time to use a blade any more), and I now get a very good shave with it day after day. Three things to keep in mind for best performance: 1. Always keep it fully charged. 2. Clean it often. 3. Don't skimp on the replacement blades. Seriously. I went about two years without replacing them, and was getting a terrible shave at that point. I boughta new set, and started getting a great shave again. I get about 12-14 months on a set of blades, using the razor almost every day. It's worth it.	2003-05-14

I read various reviews about the Dr. Scholls Premium Foot spa and bought into it. It seemed like a really good product that would be beneficial. Now, the TRUTH: The day it arrived I attempted to use it. I read the instructions etc. and filled it with water. What happened, you may wonder? Well, I turned it on, and yes, it did vibrate. It also warmed up the water after a good 10-15 minutes after I had already put in luke warm water. So yes, it did what it \\"claims\\".<br />  Now. Would I recommend that anyone but this? NEVER! Don't even think once about it! The thing has the noise level equal to a vacuum, but truthfully my vacuum has more power to it. If you want to see what this product would be like, I encourage you to get a pan and fill it with warm water. Next, get a few straws. Stick your feet in it, and blow bubbles into the water with the straws. That \\"movement\\" of water, and the speed at which you can blow is ironically almost the exact speed as the Premium Foot Spa! The vibration option is like setting your foot on a cell phone that is vibrating. When the bubbles and massage are used in combination, the effects of both, which are none-the-less minimally--MINIMALLY--stimulating, can be thought of as cancelling eachother out. You can feel them, but have no idea which is which. NOT IMPRESSED. You could easily forget that you have your feet in a tub of water. I tried it once again to ensure that the air pressure wasn't building up or that I was too impatient, but no. I waited for 15 minutes for something more than a pathetic purring but nothing happened. If you have a pool, stick your foot in and swirl it around, it could even be more pleasing as well as cheaper.<br />  My last issue: splashing water. In vibration mode, it doesn't splash- it barely does anything! In option 2, bubble mode, it splashed pretty much everywhere after a good 10 minutes.(*I also checked that water level twice to ensure it wasn't too high and even took some water out!) The machine causes little splashes to go everywhere around it. It was more stressful to watch all the water I would have to clean up at the end of this \\"relaxing\\" foot \\"treatment\\". I also have to mention that the cord was also continuously getting wet. Not only from the splashes, but because one of the foot placements that has rollers in which you have to roll your feet over, makes water spill out the back sides and the cord outlet is conviently right on that back side! The foot pieces I also have to mention are nothing but plastic. They are  very dificult to feel, if felt at all. The rollers also besides the splashing are sompletely ineffective. The accupressure/node whatever, is located in the worst possible spot, the center. It is not even in the water, but raised about it! So out of warm water into cold air and then continuous rubbing of one foot at a time on a piece of plastic which your foot doesn't exactly fit into the area causes an uncomfortable and feelingless waste of time.<br />I couldn't tell anyone to buy this, and quite frankly, you should be paid not to. I'm just GRATEFUL I didn't give it away as a present before trying it. I would be embarrassed to attach my name to the card!gh and even took some water out!)

I would have gave it 5 stars if they had half settings but all the trimmers I had used in the past have the same problem....the 2 setting is to short and the 3 setting is to long I tried putting it between the settings like I did with an old Maverick trimmer but this one will not stay, so now I just trim it on the 2 setting and wait till it grows a day or two and its perfect!	2003-05-08

However, after 13 months (one month after the warranty expired), the little lights would not work during recharging, and, even worse, it would spontaneously start running in the middle of the night.  Even after letting it run out of juice (there was no way to shut it off), it still has momentary fits and starts at random times.

We have had this product all winter and it works like a charm.  It is difficult to drain all the water, but the other vaporizer on this site has the same problem.  Just use some paper towel to blot out any excess water.  I wanted a vaporizer as opposed to a humidifier because I wanted warm steam for my son's congestion.  I use it with the liquid vapor steam and have had great success. By the way, the liquid is NOT a mess. Get the stuff you add directly to the water...not the stuff that goes in the dispenser.  Make sure you follow directions for weekly cleaning and you shouldn't have a problem.  It's really a decent product for the money!	2003-05-05

At the hospital where I used to work, we used this Tanita scale in a nationally-funded clinical trial to keep track of medication effects on people's weight and body fat, so you'd better believe it's accurate!<br />So when my fiance and I decided to try dieting in preparation for our wedding, I decided that this was the scale to get.  Even better, it showed up in my gold box that week!  What's great about this one is that it also shows you what's going on inside -- your body fat percentage, rather than just what weight you are.  I found this encouraging because when you work out and put on muscle, you may put on some weight (because of the extra density of muscle) but this scale lets you know that you're dropping body fat, which is the more important issue.<br />It's incredibly easy to use, and I like the fact that my fiance and I could enter each of our personal data (male/female, height, athlete/non) into the machine and then personalize the machine for each of us with the two handy buttons on the side.  No entering all that extra data every time you get on the scale!	2003-04-23

But it works wonders on those recurring spots of tension and stress that seem to be just out of reach, or impossible to relax.<br />I will lay on my stomach, turn it on and rest it on one of those sore spots while I read or just try to relax.

I like it much better.  In design, I find it easier to handle than the sonicare becasue it is slimmer and easier to maneuver.  It also has a smaller footprint on my sink.<br />The brushheads are smaller, making it easier to get to places in your mouth that are hard to reach with the sonicare brushes.  I wasnt sure how much difference this would make until I had a tooth cleaning last week and the person doing it commented on how much better my teeth look.  Interestingly they sell the sonicares out of their office...<br />I like the rechargable brushes because you dont need to replace batteries.  I dont take it when I travel, I take a regular toothbrush.  It makes a big difference, that you can feel.<br />I think this is an excellent product.

After 30 years of shaving with the old shaving gel and razor routine, I entered the 21st century with the Norelco 7885XL and am extremely pleased that I have. The convenience of being able to shave on-the-go and the closeness this Norelco provides are both well worth the investment. Although, I've got to mention that I got a little lucky price-wise because the Norelco 7885XL magically appeared as one of my Amazon \\"Gold Box\\" promotion items so I jumped at the chance to buy this model at an incredible savings! Other than an excellent shave, my favorite features are the \\"time remaining\\" and the \\"needs cleaning\\" indicators on the LCD screen. The unit quickly charges to the full 45 minutes of run time in about an hour and is easy to clean by simply flipping open the head assembly and rinsing under the faucet. Did I mention quiet? Yep, the 7885XL is whisper quiet. Did I mention close? I'm getting a closer shave than I've ever gotten from a hand razor. Price, convenience, money-back guarantee from Norelco (use it for 21 days and get a full refund if you're not happy) - Buy it! Chances are, you'll be pleased you did.	2003-04-11

There is considerable, but predictable variation in body fat percentage measurements. The scale uses electrical conductivity of your body to estimate body fat percentage.  This will be affected by your hydration status and probably also by vasodilatation and any moisture on your feet. Since one tends to be a little dehydrated in the morning, body fat percentages are consistantly higher in the AM than later in the day.  If you check your body fat percentage immmediately after a warm shower, it will read a little lower, probably due to vasodilatation.  What all this means is that a single body fat measurement is going to vary up to several absolute percentage points from the true value.  If you check readings at the same  time of day under similar circumstances, or if you take multiple measurements throughout the day and average them, the results are pretty consistant.  I find that body fat percentage in my case varies from about 18.5% to a little over 21% (and hopefully it will continue to drop).  I think the scale is most useful for demonstrating a trend in body fat percentage up or down rather than precisely determining an absolute number.  I think that is what most people are interested in, and for that purpose I think the scale works fine.  I agree that a back lit display would be nice, but it would no doubt reduce battery life time.	2003-04-05

Blades do an excellent job but, being lazy, I just don't like the time it takes to shave that way. And yes, I used it as directed for the 30 days recommended.<br />I am betting that those who say that this Panasonic razor shaves \\"as close as a blade\\" are either very young with still-soft hair or those who hate using a blade so much that they are willing to make do with much less.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad razor as far as electrics go. It feels good in the hand and cuts about as well as any other. But you can get the same shaving performance from cheaper models.<br />The problem is, as with all electrics, the razor just doesn't give a close shave. The \\"five o'clock shadow\\" shows up by 2-3 o'clock. If you have a formal afternoon meeting, late date, etc. you'll have to shave one, maybe two, more times before the day is done. Anything longer than a day or two of growth requires several full passes to get the job done. Obviously, a one-pass blade is faster in this situation.<br />Of course, with the Panasonic there are no bleeding cuts due to early morning carelessness. If you just need a fast shave that's good enough if not great, it's faster than using a blade. This Panasonic is also quieter than many other electrics.<br />If you really truly want an electric razor, my recommendation is to look at cheaper models first. Fancy features such as the high speed linear motors and wet/dry capability don't add to the final quality of the shave.	2003-03-17

With my old scale, I would step on and off the scale three times in short order and get three different weight readings. The scale would not always reset to zero and I constantly had to reset it. I could not possibly get accurate readings.<br />Originally, I was looking for a regular digital scale, but the body fat measurement feature of the Tanita scales caught my eye.<br />I have used the Tanita TBF-622 for five weeks now, as part of an exercise and diet weight loss plan and am very happy with the performance and features of this product.<br />One important thing I've learned using this scale is the relationship between weight and body fat reading. While undergoing a serious exercise program, actual weight loss may be offset by gain in muscle mass. In other words, you can lose fat by exercise and diet, but gain muscle mass, offsetting some of the weight loss. The health benefits of more muscle mass include a higher body metabolism, which means more calories burned to support the 'new' muscle even at rest.<br />I imagine the frustration of a person undergoing a serious weight loss program including moderate or vigorous exercise, when their weight loss goals are not attainable because an ordinary scale just gives you an overall weight reading.<br />With the Tanita TBF-622, you are given the opportunity to monitor your weight and body fat reading on a daily basis which allow you to keep constant tabs on your progress. With the scale, you are given comprehensive written instructions explaining body fat, what is the appropriate range for your sex and age and blank charts to track readings.<br />One note ' this scale is probably not appropriate for the casual dieter or those not on a serious exercise and/or weight loss plan. In order for the user to get benefit from a diet/exercise program, it is necessary to first establish your 'baseline' reading to get a starting point. This means one or two (or more) weeks of readings before commencing a program to get an 'average.' Because hydration can affect the body fat reading, you must take daily measurements at the same time of day under the same circumstances ' three hours after a meal, three hours after sleep, etc. (For me, this means before dinner each day.) Taking a reading at different times will not give an accurate picture.<br />Some reviewers have complained that the scale is not accurate for body fat.  I have found it to be very accurate so long as I weigh each day at the same time and under the same conditions as the owner's manual states.<br />This is an affordable scale for serious fitness and weight loss tracking.reading to get a starting point.

I recently purchased a brand new Braun 5441 Flex Integral shaver. This was my first electric shaver. I bought it after almost 12 years of using blades. I had been using the Mach 3 for the past couple of years and getting a very close shave. The problem which led me to seek an electric alternative was that with blades, I was getting far too many razor bumps, and extremely dry skin. They also wore out very quickly. I had heard electric shavers could not get as close as a blade but I thought if I bought one which was supposed to be top of the line, it would be able to get the job done without the problems of using a blade. I was pretty disappointed with the 5441. I didn't get a very close shave at all and the hair in certain areas such as the upper lip, and the chin posed the most difficult to shave. I had to shave for almost 10 minutes and do many passes to get as close of a shave as I would have with a blade. The reason I give this shaver a rating of 3 rather than something lower is because I have a feeling that it still may be a high quality electric shaver. It's just electric shavers that aren't very good, but as far as they go I got the feeling this was one of the better ones. I guess it's true what they say... electric shavers just can't get as close as a blade. I will probably continue to use it because it did significantly reduce my razor bumps, and this improved my skin quality. But I will continue using a blade for my upper lip because at least in that area, the shaver just couldn't cut it.	2003-03-17

Faced with the fact that i could no longer find replacement foils for my OLD Braun I began the search for a new shaver.  I was immediately unimpressed with the design of the long hair trimmer on the new XP models so prevalent in stores, and the reviews confirmed the flip-out design was awkward to use.  If you let your beard grow for a few days over the weekend or when you go camping, you need a good long (relative to 2 day stubble) hair trimmer.  The trimmer on the 6520 is activated by pressing the face panel switch all the way up--the foil head automatically pivots out of the way.  The blades stand pependicular to the length of the shaver at the end of the extension, so you get a very solid 90 angle that makes it very easy to take off the long beard growth and neck hair.  (Anyone claiming difficulty with this feature should not be using an electic device!)<br />Though this model was originally released a couple years ago, the replacement parts are the same as the current XPs, so I'm assured of finding them when needed.<br />The occilation of the 6520 head is only 100 cycles slower (7700 vs 7800) per min. as the $...+ model, and the shave is fine and smooth.  Charge time is fast and it keeps on going.  I had used my old Braun for the past year on the cord since the battery konked, and the 6520 will work on the cord as well--don't underestimate this nice feature.  The 6520 also has a travel lock switch that keeps the shaver from activating in the jumbling of your travel bag.<br />Consumer Report (Nov. '02) rated this model just under the $... Braun, and you can pick it up here at half the stated price!<br />One tip:  keep your old, zippered Braun shave case.  The 6520 comes with an open top carrying case with 2 louzy velcro tabs--nothing will stay in that.<br />THIS IS BUY FAR A FANTASTIC VALUE and J&R came through Nicely!	2003-03-10

This is by far my favorite yet.  I am picky about trimmers, too.  In fact, I bought this trimmer only two weeks after buying and trying a different trimmer and being totally disappointed.  I gave that one to my dad, and stepped up to the ER203K.  How can I be excited about a trimmer?  One reason is enough -- this trimmer has the finest and most numerous adjustment settings of any trimmer I have ever found.  With my previous trimmers, I was always stuck between settings -- I could never get those extremely dense areas of my beard short enough without accidentally leaving a whole in my beard.  Not with this guy, though.<br />Everything else (battery life; cord; construction; ease of use) is very good about this trimmer, but the setting selection is what I really can rave about!	2003-03-10

While the old model worked wonderfully the 5414 did not do quite as well.  Now after using it for 3 years the battery is shot.  I don't really have much use for the rechargable feature but in this model Braun seems to have made a poor choice in power routing.  It seems that in order for power to get to the motor it first must run through the batteries, even when plugged in to the wall.  <BR>This idea can be tested by draining the batteries and then trying to use the shaver in a corded fashion.  It'll work but at a reduced speed, as the batteries charge the speed increases.  <BR>Even at its best this shaver never did very well.  It irritates my skin much more than the previous model and takes much longer to finish the job.  <BR>Given the price of Braun's shavers I'm somewhat skeptical about buying another one.  <BR>I have no need for all the gimmicky add-ons like tilting heads or self cleaning, I'd just like a decent shave.  <BR>Amazon has had the 7505 refurbished at an excellent price, maybe it's worth a try.	2003-03-10

My old faithful Norelco gave up the ghost, and I decided to replace it with a new ES8003W Panasonic Linear Shaver. I also ordered a small bottle of Shave Oil from the net.  I promptly received the shaver and the oil.  Following the directions for the oil I gave myself the first shave with the new shaver/oil combination. All I can say is WOW!  The shaver performed way above my expectations giving me a super smooth shave unlike any shave I have experienced using several different electric shavers over the years. Being so pleased with the results I went on to shave my head. Previously I had used Wahl hair clippers to shave my head as close as possible, always a little reluctant to use a razor on my scalp. Again, following the directions on the oil bottle, I proceeded to rub the oil on my head and started to shave.  Again, I was blown away by the results. Not one bit of razor burn or irritation of any kind on my head, face or neck!  I am totally satisfied with the results and would recommend this combination to anyone who has uses and electric shaver.	2003-03-09

But no closer (in fact a little less close ) than a Braun foil razor I've had for 4 years, which I bought reconditioned.  <br />Caveat:  I use the electric razor to shave my head.  When I did half my head with the Norelco and 1/2 with the Braun, the Braun was closer-even if barely.  The Norelco was on it's closest setting, too. Also, the Norelco's blades were brand new, and my Braun's were about 6 months old!  This was most noticeable at the end of the day, when the Braun stubble was a little shorter.  Also, when I used the Norelco on my face and the back of my neck, it gave me razor burn like I have never experinced with a foil razor.<br />As another reviewer here said, change your foil and blades (for me about once every year or so) and that's the real key to good performance. Finally, it just makes sense to me that the thinner the metal between the balde and your face, the closer the shave.  Foil wins!	2003-03-09

I've used several different types and brands of shavers over the years. Two Braun models, a Panasonic wet and dry, three or four Norelcos. I always go back to the Norelco triple heads because they work faster and seem to do the most with the least amount of touch up and irritation. My latest is the so called James Bond model. I never would have bought it except that I'd accumulated several gift certificates. Against my better judgement I bought this but can say now that I'm glad I did. Reason seems to point that this is really not a significant improvement from my existing Norelco. But... no touch up required from a Gillette manual razor, little to no irritation on my neck. The head design is a little more flexible. Ergonimically it is a joy to use. Great battery life. Subjectively the blades seem to rotate a little faster and the hole design of the head is a little different. Easy to clean by holding it under a faucet. It comes with a cool little stand too. Is it worth two bills? Probably not but what the heck. Great razor.	2003-02-23

Better then my triple-foil R*******n electric shaver. Mows my 4-day-old stubble with no problems. Quieter then my other shaver.<BR>The Nivea Lotion: Makes for a smooth shave. One cartridge lasts about 12 days. Longer if you pat a little water on the skin before shaving. Change the lotion cartridge in a few seconds. It appears to me that my skin is tighter and smoother after a month of use, like a minor face-lift.<BR>Cleanup: Open the heads and rinse the cutters with hot tap water from both sides along with the top of the shaver.

My old 2 blade Panasonic Shaver was not giving me the close shave it used to so I started shopping for a new one. For the price, I thought this was a good deal and decided to go for it. It cuts through my beard like swiss cheese and afterword my face feels as smooth as a baby's bottom. The charge lasts a long time and the charge indicator is helpful in letting you know when its getting low. Clean up is easy using lotion soap. This method has kept the shaver from smelling funky like my old one. One complaint is the on button being hard to use when wet because of several factors such as it not being raised enough to get a good purchase on and the amount of force needed to move it. Also, a chunk of the foil came off while using it. But, I think this is because I had dropped it a couple of times and dented it. The foil is NOT covered under the warranty and costs about $25 so be careful.	2003-02-22

It does give a decent shave, but don't expect the same smooth results as razor.  No electric shaver can do that.<br />My complaint is with the bells and whistles that make this shaver more expensive.  They really don't add much, so if given the choice again I would probably just buy a less expensive model.  To be specific:<BR>The \\"turbo\\" feature speeds up the blades a bit but doesn't make a noticable difference in shaving.<br />The LED readout gives a digital indicator of charge time remaining. After a full charge it reads 40 (minutes), but after a single five minute shave its down to 22 minutes.  A few shaves later it reads 16 minutes or so, then it suddenly jumps down to a flashing zero to indicate its time to recharge.  So, it really only serves as a general battery life indicator, not a true indicator of shave time remaining.<br />The flashing \\"time to clean\\" indicator really doesn't serve much purpose either because it doesn't really measure how clean the razor is, but seems to just measure how long its been since you last removed the screen.<br />Bottom line - decent shave, but not really worth the extra bucks to get the bells and whistles.	2003-02-18

This product has been a great help in the recovery of my foot.  Although the description leads you to believe that you get a heater, massager and bubbler all-in-one (you don't); this product is great.  The massager is on the outside of the unit as well as the heater.  I know people have complained that you have to put hot water in it..but be real...is that so hard???  This unit keeps the water hot for at least 20 minutes (which is more than the recommendid time to soak) and it delivers on all of it's promises.  <br />After surgery my foot was stiff, sore and I couldn't bend my toes.

You're definitely conscious of these 2 isolated points and of trying to position at least one of them next to the body area to be treated.<br />2. The power supply is fairly massive and heavy. No doubt it will cover up 3 outlets on your wall plate or power strip.<br />3. The pad, like others I've tried, doesn't get very warm, thanks to a built-in safety regulator.<br />4. The velcro straps might be useful if you're able to wear the pad; otherwise, they quickly get in the way. Also, the detachable electrical cord has a tendency to detach itself.<br />5.

The Remington R-9300 is the best I have ever used.  It provides a very close, comfortable and reasonably fast shave without the noise and vibration one would have with a foil shaver.  It has several attractive features, such as a nice travel pouch instead of a small cloth sack and a useful LCD display of shaving minutes remaining.  Please be aware that it takes a couple of weeks of use before one's skin adapts to the shaver.  The manufacturer states that the shaver can be cleaned using tap water.  I have not attempted to clean the shaver with water due to my unfortunate experience with a Norelco Quadra action.  Instead I simply use the cleaning brush provided, complemented by an air cleaner which is particularly helpful when cleaning the combs.  I hope this review is helpful.	2003-02-13

Perhaps I'll get off the frequent dentist plan I'm on if I keep using it.  This toothbrush has 2 speeds, fast and turbo.  The 40,000 cycles per minute, which far exceed anything I've ever used, pulled stuff off my teeth and gums that I didn't even know was there, even by flossing.  The IP brush head was also a nice twist, since it got really into the spaces where the regular brush doesn't go.<br />I had another brand previously, but wasn't really impressed with it.  Then I switched to the grocery store battery powered devices which worked better than my first one.<br />The travel case is a nice way to store the toothbrush for even daily use, since it's not recommended to store your brushes on the charger.  Battery life is greatly shortened that way.  I wished I had or could get a second case.	2003-02-11

You can easily fill it in your tub in an upright position while holding the handle with one hand.  It is quiet and seems to provide a nice white noise for sleeping.  It was a great price considering how much you could pay for a humidifier and the filters for one.  There is no filter involved here.  It keeps my baby's room slightly warmer because of the warm mist.  I'm told humidifiers make the room colder, so this product is ideal for the winter season.  The only downfall of this product is that you have to be careful to keep kids away, because the mist is hot.	2003-02-06

I started my electric shaving experience with a Norelco. It was admittedly awful though somewhat less painful than the blade! I moved to a foil shaver (Braun) for about 10 years (two shavers) and recently had the opportunity for a full-featured upgrade. I was able to try the new Brauns at a local shaver store and was impressed and then tried the Spectra model. I was FLOORED. This is an excellent shaver. Battery life is unreal (I get about four-six weeks -- can't estimate well yet as I have only charged it ONCE after initial charge!), cleans in water, shaves quickly (and well), and very quiet. Yes, there is hype and gimmicry on this model (but the color, display, and battery are great!) and you may do just as well with a [less expensive] Spectra (or Quadra), but this is a great system. It looks and works really really great! :)<br />UPDATE (11/13/03): I am nearing a year of use on this shaver and nothing has changed. This is a great product.

I've been using those cheap travel shavers to get by, but after this shaver, I can now say that it is worth every damn penny. Although it is expensive, I can tell you that this will give you the best shave compared to other electrics. I have read SEVERAL reviews prior to purchase, and the ES8003 Panasonic linear came out to be one of the BEST top performers in the electric foil category. <br />The wet/dry feature is one of the best, and shaving in the shower with a little shave gel gets me a closer shave than the blades, with faster shave time. The wet is absolutely the best shave, and feels good. Make sure you don't shave TOO much or else you'll get bumps and nicks. <br />The dry is not as close as the wet, but it is still good. I wouldn't say the dry shave is EXTRAORDINARY compared to the blade, but it can hold it's own. It is extremely great on those pesky \\"peach fuzz\\" kinda hair. It gets the stubbly stiff beard hair very well too. <br />Overall, I would say it is worth every penny, will do the job great, and you'll use it for years to come. I also like how this shaver used the NI-MH rechargeable instead of the NiCad which can deteriorate over time.	2003-02-03

Side burn trimmer is not as good as Remington or Braun.<br />The \\"wet shave\\" used with shaving cream or liquid soap may excite you, however be careful, due to the razor's weight it may slip right out of your hands!!<br />Bottom line: Not any better or worse than a Remington or Braun. I'm told however the replacement screen and cutter are more expensive than Remington & comparable to Braun...	2003-02-03

On the good side, you don't have to worry about gashing your face with an errant swipe of the blade and subsequently reaching for the stiptic or the charmin.  To me, that was the huge selling point. And this thing does remove enough of the visible facial hair such that you can show up to the office and not have everyone think you've gone Don Johnson. But dont read the positives as a ringing endorsement. It does not, repeat, does not get anywhere near as close as your blade and a can of Edge does, and if you have a major 5 o'clock shadow problem, you might need a touch up around noon. The biggest negative i see with this thing though, and maybe it's due to my unfamiliarity, is what it does to your neck if you apply more than a smidgen of pressure. Big red, rashy-looking glotches that i fear will only intensify as it gets warmer outside. Maybe they will go away as the neck gets used to it.  In sum---if you're not joe hairball and are sick of blades and can live with red spots on your neck, this thing probably would work for you. If you are of a meticulous nature and have a problem with a slightly unkempt shaven appearance, you're probably better off with your Trac IIs.	2003-02-01

This was my first electirc shaver and I haven't liked the experience. The primary motivation for buying this shaver was to save time in the morning and get a closer shave without damaging the skin. Except for getting a closer shave, it takes much longer to shave with the electric shaver and skin get very red. The shaver is totally not suitable for shaving on soft skin like that near the neck. It takes almost twice the time to shave than it does with an ordinary razor. It does not work well when your hair has grown for 3-4 days.	2003-01-31

After using a Braun 255 for almost a decade without a problem, I made the assumption that Braun shavers were superior.   I was wrong!  The 5416 does not shave close.  My old 255 still works fantastic and much better than this newer Braun.  The Flex head is a gimmick to compete with the Norelco Floating head,,, but it's just a gimmick.  I'm pretty sure that the 255 was made by German craftsmen,,, and that Gillete (the current owner), now makes them in Mexico.  It may work for you if you have no qualms about taking 20 minutes to shave.  My 255 did it in 3 minutes.  It's just good enough not to be sent back.  But I'm going to think long and hard before buying another Braun.  I'm tempted to continue using the 255 on an electric cord.	2003-01-30

I compare this shaver to my first Microwave oven and my first color TV set. <br />Like a lot of guys, I figured my choice was (1) put up with blood spewing from nicks and cuts, esp. around my chin and nose; or (2) razor burns from electric shavers that would leave broad patches of beard unshaven.<br />This razor rocks! I use it wet, with either soap or what's left of my canned shave cream. I use it daily, and use it like a grid (across and then up and down, or visa versa --it' morning and I don't give a damn). From day 1 I got a decent shave, and only once (day 3) I got carried away and drew a few pricks of blood. It never happened again.<br />I love this product. I hated shaving, but hated the itchiness of a beard even more (not to mention the comparisons of me to Jesus Christ, which is even more disturbing to a secular humanist like myself).

Oh, come on here! Men have visions of a sexy James Bond shave that attracts the babes like a magnet?! What a great advertising campaign! Why don't they get Shaquille O'Neal and Brad Pitt to shave in TV commercials as a follow-up! These over-priced razors would fly off of the shelves then! First off, simple physics....NO electric shaver came shave as close as a plain razor blade. The distance between the cutting blades and the face is increased by the metal shield, no matter how thin they advertise it is. So you are faced with a mediocre &quot;close&quot; shave. A cheap Bic razor shaves closer because it directly contacts the skin. Don't get me wrong....I am not against electric shavers. I have used them most of the time because of the economic advantage. Why spend many dollars buying throwaway disposable razors when the electric shaver stands ready to do the job for free after the initial cost?! But this Spectra razor is a pure conjured gimmick to increase Norelco's profit margin. Any man who wants a good basic electric shave would do well to spend sixty bucks and buy the basic Quadra-action shaver, then invest in several sets of replacement cutting blades. The shave is the same irregardless....it boils down to having sharp cutting blades and regularly cleaning and maintaining the shaver. But if you think you are James Bond....Go ahead and drop two C-notes on this gimmick! Norelco will thank you for it and my face will be as clean shaven as yours for much less money!	2003-01-26

It gave him a very close shave.  I would say that the shave was excellent except for one problem.  The shaver was extremely noisy.  It sounded like a chain saw in his hand.  You could hear him shave from all over the house including the outside.  The noise the shaver was generating was just too much (it would drown out the television) so I regretably returned it back the next day and purchased a different Panasonic shaver - ES8003.  This new shaver felt the same except the noise was nowhere as bad.  I had to pay more money for the new shaver, but my husband is pleased and if he is pleased then I am pleased too.

Honestly, the Panasonic doesn't give me as close a shave at first. But after a few passes it gets nice and close and I can't tell the difference. The nice thing about the Panasonic is that it never feels like it's \\"pulling\\" hairs out of my face. It takes a little longer to shave, but the lack of pain in worth it. :)<br />It's body is a metal construction and feels very solid and durable. It is easy to clean, and the foil lasts over a year, the blades 2 years.

They gave an excellent rating to both models. They also gave an excellent rating to the higher end Norelco's. <br />I haven't used an electric shaver for over 10 years as I was not impressed with their closeness back then (I owned a Braun then too). But, after getting sick of razor burn here and there in the summer or having my face get dry as hell after shaving with a blade in the winter, I decided to give them another try. I also like to have a clean shaven face on the weekends when I don't feel like taking a shower.<br />I guess things have changed because this thing shaves pretty close to a blade! No, an electric shaver will never cut as close as a blade so if that's what you really like then this may not be for you. However, the technology is definitely improving.<br />This model does a great job of shaving very close on the flatter expanses of my face, like my cheeks, but a little less so around my chin area. Also, my hair is not thick and burly like some guys, but by no means is my facial hair sparse (I'm a white Italian-Irish mutt). I prefer this style shaver over the Norelco. I never liked the Norelco system and you have to replace those blades every year at the cost of about [$$$]. These should last 18 months and you could probably get along just fine for 2 years if you have a thinner beard. The blade replacement on these is about [$$$].<br />If you want a quick and decent shave that you can even do in the car on the way to work, then this a great option. The battery is strong and you can get at least 4 shaves on one charge. I hear the high-end Panasonic 8003 or something is great but it cost [$$$] and using some kind of shaving cream is recommended with its use.  What's the point? I'm using this thing for convenience.  [Heck], if I have to do that just give me the [darn] blade.<br />I bought this sucker new on Ebay for [$$$] so I can't complain. You might be able to find a deal on one too.	2003-01-21

It's the first time I've had an electric that I actually bothered to replace the cutters and foil last year rather than buy a whole new shaver.

I used an electric 10 years ago and it was average at best.  Since then I've used a blade but had to battle with nicks and razor burn.

This equipment made that much nicer!  The only drawback is that it does not heat the water for you.  You have to put hot water in it to begin with.  The Infared heat will simply keep the water warm.

The Quadra was horrible (a bad shave that took 10 minutes) and I recently junked it.  Given the above, I was a bit hesitant to pay for Norelco's latest gadget and looked into buying another Reflex Action (it worked for me and now was only $70).  Either way, being that it had a money back guarantee, I ended up buying the 8894XL - excellent shaver - fast and close.  The Spectra is nothing like the Quadra and closer than the Reflex Action.  Of course, a 100 minute battery and rinse-ability are good to have as well.  Worth it.	2003-01-13

I have a fairly heavy, mature beard.  To get a smooth, complete shave takes quite a while compared to my safety razor.  I also find I must shave again before an evening out, or I feel &quot;sandpapery.&quot;  With the safety razor shave, that evening touchup was optional.  <br />One benefit that surprised me however, using the MS3-4000 is like getting a facial massage every shave - even seems to be toning up my face muscles!

There is little doubt that it will romp through 100 minutes in style. It is pretty much what I had been led to expect.<br />SPEED--The only thing slower than an old Norelco is 'stop'. The speed was significantly improved by the newer line, specifically the 5821XL. The Spectra is even faster, however psychologically, it seems like it could be lumbering along. Perhaps this is due to the razor being very quiet. It just seems a bit slower than my Grundig Avantgarde, but it isn't. Actually, it seems to get the job done about as quickly as my Panasonic Wet-Dry, which is faster than the wind.<br />CLOSENESS--It gives the illusion of not delivering a shave closer than the Grundig, but it does. In fact, my neck began feeling sensitive immediately due to the closeness (head pressure) of the shave. I completely acclimated after a week and this no longer is a problem. I probably should have put the razor on a more gentle setting but I just set it to N (normal...for the closest shave)and went about business. There is a 9 position setting that seems a bit over-hyped to me. I assume there are subtle differences, but after a short time, you will settle upon a setting and go from there. The wheel that sets this is almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass is not the most user-friendly thing I have seen, but in the long run is no big deal.<br />ERGONOMIC FEEL OF RAZOR--Excellent. The thumb naturally falls directly over the recessed electronic on-off switch.<br />DISPLAYS--Gives you elapsed time display of current minutes used as well as an overall display of remaining minutes is a very easy to read format. Occasionally a visual logo of a fosset appears that indicates when you should clean your razor under running water. This feature, called an 'Automatic Cleaning Indicator' seems to be hap-hazzard at best. There does not seem to be any correlation between amount of debris contained within the hair chamber and the display. Actually, just open the hair chamber (quick release button at the base of the head complex flips up the assembly) and give a quick blow after each shave and all returns to squeeky clean without having to resort to the Chineese water torture for the quick rinse off. Can't shave in wet, but cleaning is much quicker and easier to accomplish than for any other shaver I have owned, save for the Panasonic W/D.<br />PROTECTIVE COVER--Plastic, as per the industry. At best, they tend to .... This is not much better. Oh, it doesn't fall off all the time as does the Remmington Interceptor, but needs to be placed in a certain manner. There are 3 grippers on the cover. The slightly widest one goes to the back...that is, if you want a reasonable fit. I overcame this by puting a red mark on the obease one. Head covers are a big deal to me. That is what I like about the rather over-priced Grundig (built in and rolls into position).<br />TRIMMER--What can I say? It is a Norelco. You shave near your sideburns at your own risk. The good news however, is that the built in trimmer seems to get the job done better than most. The downside is that with other more conventional razors, we tend to do most of the dirty work during the shave proper, thus relegating the built in trimmer (worthless on so many makes) to a lesser usage.<br />RELIABILITY--Can't say after only a few weeks. Quien Sabe?, but if it is similar to other Norelco's, and I don't see why not, it should be very good. Certainly much better than the Panasonic line (especially lLinears)that sometimes die unpredictably. Once down for the count, they can't be repaired. If not under warranty, one is dead meat. The Spectra has a 2 year warranty coupled with a 60 day money-back guarantee (whatever that means...shipment costs, delays, etc.).<br />BOTTOM LINE--It seems well worth the money. I didn't give it a '5' because I don't view any razor as being worthy. I am still looking for my absolute favorite, the Eltron Universal to return to the market. Not as fast as some...a lousy trimmer, but man is it good to your face (provided you use the gold foil which has not been produced for many years). Not to be confused with the newer Eltrons, which are not even better (at least to me) than a Braun.<br />Addenda: It is now slightly over 1 month of usage. All is exactly as I found it initially. I have drained down to zero on the display on two separate occasions. Suggest you do that in order to properly condition the batteries. A full charge for me is aprox. 103 minutes. The shave is perhaps the most gentle of all my electric razors. Speed seems to be more than adequate.lute favorite, the Eltron Universal to return to the market.

We were worried that she might be afraid of the motor, or that it moved by itself. But she just couldn't get enough. She would ask several times a day to brush her teeth! Our son is only twenty months, but we're ordering one for him now. He'll only use it with our hands on it as well, but our daughter has no trouble using it by herself. There haven't been any issues with quality of the brush. We've left it off the charger for a full day and the battery has held the charge just fine. I never thought I'd be a fan of electrical toothbrushes (especially one plastered with Disney logos), but I've been convinced. My only concern is the cost of replacement heads -- $7.99. But if it gets them excited about brushing at an early age (they were good brushers to begin with) and does a more thorough job, I'll break down and buy in.	2003-01-09

Recently my old electric shaver died, so I had to buy a new one. Since I have tough whiskers and sensitive skin, finding a shaver I can use without hurting the skin on my face and throat is difficult. But, fortunately, I had recently seen some ads on TV about the new Norelco Spectra shavers which have nine adjustable settings to allow them to be customized for closeness of shave and skin sensitivity. I was fascinated by this feature but, quite frankly, I was somewhat put off by the price -- which is significantly greater than I had ever previously paid for a shaver. But, on the other hand, I really wanted a shaver that would not hurt my sensitive skin -- and Norelco shavers have an excellent reputation for quality -- so I took a chance and bought a Spectra. Frankly, using a Spectra is unlike any of the dozen or more shavers I've used over decades of shaving. At the proper setting -- which requires a little (but not too much) trial and error -- it gives a comfortable shave much faster than I've ever experienced before. And the comb/cutter assembly can be cleaned quit simply with running water. Also, it has an indicator to show how much shaving time is left after each shave. If the adjustability, fast shaves, and features of this shaver appeal to you, you will probably find it worth the price.	2003-01-08

I HATED electric shavers.  They always hurt, never held a charge well enough not to take the charger on a week long vacation, and were hard to clean properly.<br />That all changed when I gave this shaver a chance.  It took about a month (yes a month) to get used to it and during that time I got ingrown hairs and razorburn a few times.  But after the \\"break in\\" period, this thing has been amazing.  It holds a charge for days and days of daily use.  It is easy to clean because you can rinse it with water.  It is powerful (13000 RPMs) and this really makes a difference in the shave quality after a few days of using it without recharging it.  The linear feature keeps the RPMs up during these extended no-charge periods to give you a very comfortable shave.<br />And for those of you who say that you can't get as close as a blade...I thought that too during the break-in period but the more I use it, the more my face gets used to it and the shaver gets dang near as close as a blade.  The only difference I see is that when you shave with a blade, the shave lasts a bit longer but if you use this shaver daily, there is virtually no difference.<br />This also has saved me time in the morning.  I hated lathering up to manually shave and now I don't have to.<br />One minor drawback is that some of the hair that has been cut falls out of the head of the shaver as you use it but this is very minor to me.<br />All in all, this is a worthy buy - a really great product!	2003-01-07

I am 18 and originally started out using a razor, but found it time consuming and wasn't pleased with the nicks. So, I went searching for an electric. Of course, being pressed for cash, I opted for a (cheaper)Norelco. Big miskatke. The thing hurt like none other, and besides the awful razor burn, it also tugged and pulled at the hair and my face, often resulting in cuts. Thankfully, I lost it on an Amtrak over the summer, so it gave me a good excuse to go out and buy a new one. I was intrigued by the commercials I saw for the Braun Synchro, so I succumbed to clever advertising and put down (more money) for this thing (should be cheaper now). Worth the money? Every dime! The shave is incredibly smooth. No more tugging! It lacks slightly on longer neck hair, and tends not to cut it, so once a week I usually do a quick one-over with a razor to take care of that problem. I believe this is as close a shave you can get without using a razor. Very smooth. Your girlfriend will dig it. Razor burn is minimal, if even noticed. If you have sesitive skin like mine, the Nivea Aftershave Balm works like a charm. The self-cleaner is very efficent and will complete the clean in about 15 minutes. It is somewhat loud, but not that bad. It should also be noted that the cleaning solution has a lemon scent to it, so often your bathroom has this smell after it cleans. No big deal. It leaves your razor lemon fresh in the morning. The cartriges are kinda expensive, so I found using the cleaner ever other day works just as well and will prolong the life of the solution by a month. This will save you a good deal of money in the long run. The razor has three options, which include a pivoting head, a locked head, and the sideburn trimmer. The trimmer works very well, and the locked position helps in hard to shave places (i.e. upper lip). The foil is delicate, so be careful not to mess around with it to much. I broke one already, and they dont come cheap. However, the delicate foil allows for the close shave, so the trade off is worth it. The battery charge is remarkable, allowing for almost a full month of shave time without recharging. This will help if you travel a lot or just like to shave away from the bathroom without the cord. I would recommend trying to get the 7526 model (minus the LCD screen). Sure, it dosen't look as cool, but you'll save (money) and most of the information it gives you is useless anyway. You also get an attractive carrying case that has room for the shaver, cord, and the brush. In any case, you owe it to yourself to just bite the bullet and buy a nice razor like this one in the first place. Your face will thank you for it, and it's better than starting out at the bottom like me.	2003-01-07

So far, its been an excellent product.  According to her, its completely accurate and consistent.  Whenever I've been to her place and stepped on it, its been consistent with previous uses.<br />The weight reads in .2 lb increments (some other body fat monitors/scales that I looked at measure in .5 lb, so watch for that).  The body fat measures in .5% increments which seems okay thus far.  Also, the scale stores settings for two different people, which is definitely a plus, like another reviewer said.<br />I actually did some semi-extensive looking around/pricing for these combo scales.  Basically, my girlfriend had already let me know that she wanted one and I kinda figured I'd forget about it and wait till the last minute when, one day, while clicking through my goldbox items, THERE IT WAS!  When I saw it, I decided to do some checking up.<br />What I found is that there are feature rich models out there that cost [$]+.<br />Well, the greatest difference overall that I found is that the more expensive ones can do the following :<br />*  memorize for like 4 to 10 different people<br />*  measure in increments of .1 lbs and .1% body fat (these are way more expensive)<br />*  i think some would talk to you (cant remember for sure but seems feasible right?)<br />*  some were really high tech cool looking<br />None of these were good enough reasons for me to spend more than I did [$]<br />Then there were the Omron ones that you hold out in front of you.  Those are great I'm sure.  The Tanitas however, are scales as well.  Obvious plus for the Tanita.<br />In long,  I'm very impressed with the 2201, both with its consistency and ease of use And I am extremely pleased that I decided to make the purchase.

My wife would rarely use the older unit as she was not overly impressed, she uses this new one everytime. She also loves the Ortho tip. My 2 boys are also using this brush (11 &amp; 13yrs) as they really like it and can notice the difference from using a manual brush.

After 14 years my old Norelco, although still working, was starting to make too much noise during shaving.  It had served me well, but when I saw \\"Die Another Day\\" I thought I would take a look at this new \\"007\\" model.  After reading the specs, I bought it.  It was better than I could have imagined!  Quiet!  It does its job with only a whisper!  The head is a bit larger and has a very interesting design to mold to your face and chin as you move it from neck to chin, etc.-- very high tech.  It is so smooth too. Honest, the first time I used it, I could not tell like it was even cutting my beard!  No iritation at all.  The same feel can be achieved on Normal or Sensitive skin settings.  It is also the closest shaving razor yet!  There is almost no difference in closeness between the 8894XL and a blade! The pop up trimmer is a little better than my old one too!  The leather case is great for travel too!  I had a friend try it (who had just received a new Braun as a gift).  I think I'm in trouble with his wife, as now he wants to get one.  <BR>The battery will hold a charge for about 33-50 shaves depending on how tough your beard is.  The cleaning interval is indicated on a display as well as the remaining number of minutes.  Very cool.  It is hard to imagine, but just running water cleans it very nicely.  I use a hair dryer to make sure it is dry before I put it away.<BR>Needless to say, I am very happy with this one.  If you need a razor, why not treat yourself to the best?  After all you \\"Only Live Twice.\\"	2003-01-02

I concur that previous reviews of the Norelco Quadra Action 7885 posted on Amazon.com were not reflective of this product's true performance. I have owned other Norelco models, as well as Brauns, and I find the new Norelco Quadra Action to be a superior shaver. At first I, too, was skeptical about the mix of slots and holes in the shaving head. I thought this may be a marketing gimmick. After significant use of this shaver, I have found that it does in fact shave closer than any other electric shaver I have used, including two previous Braun foil shavers.<BR>I also agree with an earlier reviewer who questioned the need for lotion-dispensing shavers, and shavers that must be cleaned in a special container with  a proprietary cleaning solution. I think this is just additional cost that does not contribute to increased shaving performance. The new Norelcos' can be simply rinsed clean under warm running water, with no need for elaborate cleaning devices or costly cleaning solutions. I have found that it takes 2-3 recharging cycles until the LCD meter \\"learns\\"<BR>and then accurately reports the remaining shaving time left, however, it is now fairly accurate. The unit holds sufficient charge for approximately 45 minutes of cordless shaving per one-hour recharge. The built-in reminder in the LCD display to clean the shaver is nice, but I generally rinse the unit after each shave anyway.  I do not see an appreciable difference between this shaver and the Norelco Spectra model, other than the significant cost. Save the extra $ and purchase the Quadra Action. My congratulations to Norelco for taking electric shaving to a new level.	2003-01-02

Since we started using the vaporizer his breathing has improved significantly and he has restful night sleeps.  Following are the problems:  It gets the room really warm, it runs out of water frequently thus causing the product to make really loud sounds until you fill it with more water freqently the noise will wake your baby, it does not run for 32 hours as stated on the box, the vapors seem to go from smelling like vapor rub to smoke within a few hours and it does take up a lot of room.

I just replaced a Braun 5520 with a new 6520 and am very happy with the result.  The 5520 and 6520 are very similar, with both using the same shape, cutter head, and foil.  The difference is the 6520 runs at a faster rpm. <br />Last year I bought and used one of the Norelco's that dispense lotion.  It did a good job on my neck, but my cheeks and lip area never got very smooth, and by lunch I looked like I do with a Braun shave at 8:00 pm.<br />Braun razors are very reliable.  I used my 5520 for four years, and replaced it because the battery was no longer holding its charge for more than one shave.

Ive been using Norelco and Remington electric shavers ever since I started shaving and decided recently to try a different brand. The Panasonic which had a price tag more than twice as much as what I had paid for any of my previous electrics  had caught my attention several years ago because of its wet/dry capability. I brush my teeth in the shower you see and..what? Never heard of that before? Think about the advantages: Whether you use an electric or manual toothbrush the results are the same  saliva and toothpaste paste run down your chin, hands, or gets splattered all over the bathroom. Brush your teeth in the shower and none of thats a problem  it all gets sprayed away down the drain with no hassles. And no more globs of unused toothpaste getting stuck in the sink either. (I hate it when that happens.) <br />Anyway, so I figured I could knock out one more morning hygiene task in the shower by using the Panasonic. I couldnt do that with my current Remington without electrocuting myself. Which brings me to another advantage and convenience of the Panasonic  its a long-lived, cordless rechargeable. My wife and I took a weekend trip recently and it was nice to not have to deal with the ungainly power cord from my previous shaver. After three days the Panasonic never gave one sign of running out of juice. I cant say the same for my last rechargeable. <br />The Remington and Norelco units I owned previously all did not shave close enough or missed long whiskers  especially towards the end of the cutter life. Their performance got so bad that I decided to try the Mach 3 and more recently the Schick FX blade razors. What a disaster that was at first! Hadnt ever used a blade before and  you guessed it  on my first attempt I looked like a victim from one of those slice n dice movies! But after I got the hang of it, I really liked the smooth shave either one of these razors gave  particularly the Schick. The end results werea much closer shave than what my electric razor offered. Problem was, it took too darn long! More recently I ended up starting to shave with the electric because it was faster, then finishing up with what it missed with the straight blade. Thats when I decided to give the Panasonic a chance which happened to be on sale at Sears for around a hundred bucks. <br />Guys cant wait to use our new toys so after the shaver had charged for a couple of hours at the house I give er a spin. Wow! What a difference! The Panasonic chewed up my 5 oclock like a weed eater in a spaghetti pot - and it did so without painfully yanking long whiskers out as well. After a couple of passes my face was smoother than an androids [rear]. (... see the movie Star Trek Insurrection to understand this reference.)<br />After my first shave, I was instantly sold. Thanks to the Panasonic I actually look forward to shaving in the morning now. I havent got a mirror mounted in the shower yet so I havent followed through with my original plan, but I have shaved soon after getting out of the shower while my face is still wet. The Panasonic performs even better under those conditions. <br />The pop up trimmer is perfect for trimming in those hard to reach spots or for grooming a beard and mustache or those pesky nose hairs. Yes, unfortunately on some days I can almost braid mine.<br />The Panasonic is a breeze to clean. Pop off the cover, turn it on, let it run under the water for a few seconds. Boom. Your done. Much less of a hassle than unplugging, dismantling, and cleaning my Remington. <br />A quick check on the internet told me that replacement foils and cutters for the Panasonic are only slightly more expensive than what I was paying for on my last Remington shaver.<br />I have only one complaint so far. Ive already lost the cheap, clear plastic screen protector that - like my Remington models - pop off with the slightest touch. Certainly a well engineered shaver likethis one could have come up with a better solution to protect the units screen. <br />Theres an old adage that says, You get what you pay for, and that certainly has been my experience with the 5 or 6 electric shavers Ive used over the years. Spring for the Panasonic. It costs much less than the other Sports Car razors and gives a fast, relatively quiet, smooth shave.	2002-12-30

I don't find it better than my last new and expensive Norelco, a \\"Quad Action,\\" or whatever last year's \\"Razor-du-Jour\\" from Norelco was called, and I'm really disappointed.   Each year the Norelco offers less and less value.  (Ratio of quality to price.) It is not as close, and it takes longer to shave.  The only difference I can see is the little adjustment wheel, which they've had before in different forms, the pretty pearlized colors, and the the holes versus slots moved to a different location on the perimeter of each of the three circular heads. The holes are much closer shaving, as they have always been on foil razors. Norelco claims that the slots are better for \\"longer hairs,\\" but if you shave every day, why would you have \\"longer hairs\\" on your face? The bottom line is that this model is NOT faster or closer than the previous one, although it's a bit smoother, but it IS more expensive. I keep buying these in the hope that each successive one is actually an improvement, rather than a marketing device with marginal changes. (And the \\"James Bond\\" tie-in promotional gift is simply, well, juvenile.  Anyone old enough to shave can see this is useless and unrelated.  A small package of pre-shave, a shaving stick, or cleaning/soaking fluid would make more sense.)  But the truth of the matter in my experience is that any of the past three major models (\\"Spectra,\\" \\"Quad,\\" \\"Reflex,\\" whatever) are comparable if you use an appropriate pre-shave, clean the shaver often, and replace the heads as needed.  (The ability to rinse the razor clean WAS significant, however.)  The closest Norelco was the one with the micro-thin indentation in the center of each circular head around the perimeter. The fastest one had 36 (I think) cutting blades, instead of the reduced number now. (When I asked Norelco why they cut the number of blades, they said it had something to do with the \\"hair reservoir.\\" What happened to the hair before?) I will continue to use Norelco, and I own three of them.  I have used them for 48 years, and they're still the best rotary razor.  But I wish they would wait for REAL improvements before releasing a new razor. (Maybe then the price wouldn't be so exorbitant, either.)	2002-12-27

Most reviewers complained after a year the battery life went to zero and when contacting Panasonic Customer service they were no help.  I have found my battery life is pretty much the same from when I purchased the item.  I use the razor until it is completely drained of battery life and then recharge...do not know if that is the reason the battery has lasted.  I also do not leave it on the charger.  <br />All in all the razor battery life and the cutting ability is perfect.  very happy with purchase.	2002-12-26

All of us in the test group came back with the overwhelming nod toward the Spectra in every category -- comfort, closeness and easy of use. <br />I've personally used a Norelco (the low end model) for a few years. Good but not great. This is a completely different animal with better cutting design for both better closeness on the face and more comfort on the neck and other angles. After a week of testing I really didn't want to return it. <br />The 'extra' features didn't matter much to me when I started, but my opinion quickly changed. Have a 'minutes remaining' to recharge was very useful when travelling. I knew whether I needed to bring the cord or not. That it is water resistant meant a little less worry when working near the wet sink. (I've also had this strange anxiety about it accidentally kerplunking into the toilet...now that fear is gone.) <br />There are not too many devices I use everyday, and that's how I'd justify the price. My cheaper norelco has been with me for about 5 years and I expect at least the same for this guy, so it can be amortized to about 10 cents a day. <br />I have tried and compared it to the others. Truly the best one out there, and I think you'd sacrifice a great deal taking a step down in price.	2002-12-21

While it would be very helpful to be able to measure body fat percent daily, the methodology of this machine does not work for those taking diuretics.

I expected to have everything at once: bubbles, heat, massage.  It turns out that you can only have them separately.<br />1> the \\"infrared heater\\" is not even in the bath itself.  See the palm-sized dark red thing on top of the unit, near the middle?  That has some lights in it that eventually get warm.  Its function, apparently, is to rest your heels on so they get warm.  It is outside the water line, so you can't use this feature while having your feet in the water.  I found this to be sort of lame.<br />2> if you look at the picture, you will see two gray circles at the top of the unit.  Those are the massagers, as they spin.  They are not in the bath unit, so you have to take your feet out of the bath to use them.<br />The whole unit vibrates, if you want it to.  But this just gives you a numb feeling.  Those blue squiggly tubes you see in the picture on the bottom of the foot bath.... they are stationary tubes with holes in it that release bubble if you want them to.<br />I guess I was mostly disappointed than anything, but I could have read more carefully.  I just wanted to write something so someone else doesn't assume what I assumed, that you could get massage, bubbles, and heat at the same time.  I guess you could have bubbles and vibration (but no massage) at the same time, and if you poured in hot water you could have heat too.  But this is not the same as what I expected, which, again, was mostly my own fault.	2002-12-16

I've been delaying writing this review of the Spectra 8894xl as I really wanted to use it for a month or more before I commented on it.  I'm happy to report that I'm loving it!  The only real weakness is the long hair trimmer as it's marginal at best.<br />I'm completely convinced that the Norelco rotary floating head system is far superior then the linear blade foil systems found on other razors like the Panasonic and Braun.  I've owned them all. This is not to say they don't work well, but in my experience they are more biting and do a less then adequate job in the neck area.  You can also get a circular rhythm with the rotary that you can't get with the linear. Some people complain there is less control with the Norelco, especially around the side burns.  This is true, but I've found that once you get used to navigating the Norelco it becomes second nature.<br />One thing that threw me off before the purchase was a complaint I read about this razor having slots and holes on the foils heads.  More specifically, the complaint was that it took a longer time to shave with the Spectra then it does with the Reflex action and Advantage.  I can't comment on the Reflex action but I can comment on the Advantage as I own one.  There is some truth to this!  The difference is the Advantage has many more slots and more blades as compared to the Spectra. The Spectra has 9 blades per head for a total of 27 for the three heads.  The claim is that this gives it a more open structure and allows for a sharper blade angle that lifts whiskers sooner and higher for a closer shave. The Advantage on the other hand has 15 blades per head for a total of  45 blades.  That equates to more coverage - 60% to be exact.  This combined with the fact the Advantage foil has all slots explains why you can plow through more whiskers in less time.  However, this notwithstanding, the spectra may take a little longer to shave but the configuration gives a much closer shave.  The stubble slots also do tend to take care of the shorter whiskers by catching them and allowing the blades to cut them.<br />Now a word on battery life and the LED; the battery life of 100 minutes is amazing, I've only had to charge the razor twice since I owned it.  I'm a proponent of conditioning the battery by using the charge up until you really need to charge it.  The LED is very cool as there is no more guessing about charge left and time used.<br />The nine settings on the Personal Comfort level setting is a nice touch, but I've been using the razor on the normal setting with great results.  At first I did set it back a few notches which led to less irritation at first, but now that my face is used to it the N setting works well without irritation.<br />One other thing I've found that really improves the shave. Williams Lectric Shave Utlra Pre-Shave \\"GEL\\".  This is non-greasy and much better then their oil based formula.  It really, really makes a difference.	2002-12-13

The LCD screen displaying battery life, though not necessary, is nifty (especially for those of us that like technology).  The adjustable shaving settings have been useful; I find myself using a more &quot;sensitive&quot; skin setting for my neck area.  My only complaint would be that the pop-up trimmer is horrible, so you might need to keep a razor to shave your sideburn area.  Other than that, its a great product.	2002-12-11

I have owed Brauns, Panasonics and other Norelcos.  This by far is the best I've owned.  The Spectra is too expensive, while the Reflex is old technology that involved excessive burning on my neck.  The bottom line is that this Quadra does a great job, in a short time, without burning my neck.  It charges quickly and cleans easily.  It doesn't require &quot;goo&quot; or lotions and functions well without a cleaner, which is required for the new Braun.  This is a razor that will last you for years and years.  Those considering the &quot;goo&quot; spewing razor have to ask: &quot;how long will the &quot;goo&quot; be sold?&quot;  With the new Braun, what happens when the cleaner breaks?  Bells and whistles are great until they break, then they become the reason you have to buy yet another new razor.	2002-12-10

I contacted Braun support to voice my concern and they pointed out that the manual warns against using the powder because (and this is the most critical difference between the Panasonic and every other shaver including Braun and Norelco) the shaving mechanism or engine is exposed to the elements and is not impervious to the powder that gets inside the engine eventually and renders it slower to the point of being inoperable. I have used the Panasonic Linear shaver for 5 months now and it has worked wonderfully.  I don't even need to always use the shaving powder.	2002-12-08

First of all, I would like to say that the Spectra 889n XL electric razor is without a doubt the finest I've ever owned.  I get a closer shave and more features than I could have hoped for.  I do, however, want to clear up one point which I'm not seeing a reference to in the other reviews.<br />The Norelco Spectra 8894 XL is the basic model of razor featured in the new 007 thriller \\"Die Another Day\\", but it's not the officially sponsored model.  If you're a die-hard Bond fan, the Spectra 8895 XL is the one to look for.  It is essentially the same razor as the 8894 XL, but it has the \\"007 - Die Another Day\\" movie logo painted on the side of the unit. I know most people will roll their eyes reading this, but if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of Ian Fleming's spy hero, as I am, you would be willing to spend the extra $ to get the logo on the side .<br />If you are a practical person with good taste in quality personal care gadgets, but not a huge movie or book fan, then the 8894 XL will make the most sense for you.  If you have the same discriminating taste in gadgets, but are also a fierce 007 follower, then the 8895 XL will be your weapon of choice.  I have to say that every morning I can look at the logo on my razor and smile knowing that I have the real thing.<br />As for built-in spy features, I haven't found any yet, but there is a curious button-looking thing on the back of the unit which I'm afraid to press...	2002-12-06

Dieters who become frustrated when they've been \\"good\\" but haven't lost a pound can see in tenths of a pound that perhaps, yes, they HAVE lost weight.<br />I am most impressed with the consistency of the Tanita.  The digital scale I had prior to this could vary as many as three pounds as I stepped off, then on again.  The largest variation I've encountered from such quick re-measuring on the Tanita has been two-tenths (.2) of a pound.<br />The Tanita has a \\"guest\\" mode that can be set for a one-time or casual user.  These figures are not stored in memory, but the feature allows for others to use the scale. Unfortunately, this particularly model does not have an easy \\"weight only\\" feature.  You must always select your personal number (1 or 2), wait for your data to flash (age,height,gender), and then step onto the unit.  While this only takes a few seconds, it can be annoying.  The weight measurement is displayed almost immediately, while the body fat takes approximately five seconds longer. The time it takes to get these readings is minimal, but not nearly as quick as an ordinary scale.<br />The manual says that this unit is not intended for \\"athletic\\" people.  I don't understand why this is, because they offer no explanation.  I fall into their definition of an athlete, and yet I've had no trouble with it.<br />I love the Tanita. I recommend it highly for anyone who wants something more than the average scale.  It makes a wonderful gift for either fitness buffs or the weight-conscious.something more than the average scale.

I was going after the Ultra cool Norelco (James Bond 007) model. After looking at the two, I couldnt help get over the 9300 was more than half the price of the Norelco. I'm very suprised, I've had this for a few days now and it gives a very very quick comfortable close shave. I always find it hard choosing a shaver cause I suffer from ingrown hairs and sensitive skin. The only thing I didnt like about this product is for a shaver this price it really should have a charging base. I would have given it 5 stars if it did.	2002-11-26

The instructions indicate that there is no need to fast before the test, but I noticed what I ate day to day significantly affected the readings I'd gotten.  My range had been anywhere from 160 to 210.  And the strips are very tricky to apply blood to, unless you have a gushing wound, it is hard to gauge whether the hanging drop will &quot;completely&quot; cover the pad.  On average I had wasted 1 out of 3 strips because the drop didn't cover enough of the pad for a reading.  Sorry, but I can't believe this monitor is accurate based on my experiences.	2002-11-26

On a given day, I'll get readings anywhere between 15% and 22%.  After using the scale for several months, I've seen a drop in the range of measurements.  But the scale uses other data (height, weight, gender, athlete or not) in addition to an electrical signal, so the drop in my body fat measurement may just be due to my drop in weight.<br /><br />As far as the actual number goes, I've had several friends (elite female athletes) who have had more accurate body fat tests done (water test, pod test) who say the scale reads about 5% higher than the other tests.  So it seems like the scale isn't accurate for people with low body fat.<br /><br />The scale part of the product is great. It measures weight in 0.2 pound increments, which makes it easy to monitor progress.	2002-11-16

The lightweight, ergonomic design is a pleasure to use. The soft, vinyl carrying case will hold the shaver, oil, cleaning brush, and handy comb, but not the charger. Still, you can get several weeks of trimming out of one charge, so you shouldn't need to lug it around unless you're going to be away for a very long time. As with most shavers, cleaning is a pain, but you need do this, and lightly oil the blades, only infrequently. To cap it all off, I lost the charger while moving recently. I called Remington customer service, and they sent out a replacement for free (bravo to you guys!).	2002-11-08

I was always worried about waking the baby in the next room with my old corded razor....  And the 7885XL contours to the face VERY Nicely. The individual movements of the heads allow it to go over the chin and around the mouth area very easily. I haven't gotten through my 30 day trial period yet so don't have a full history shaving with it yet. But the technological advancements in the last 10 years show. <br />Price was comparable to the low end Spectra's and I didn't see a need for the spring adjustment for sensitivity.<br />Cleaning has been much easier than my old triple head system!	2002-11-07

I've been shaving with Braun for years now, but getting a good neck shave always took a little more effort than rest of my face.

It's very painful and the big red welts it leaves look terrible. <BR>* The much-vaunted sensitivity adjustment just adjusts the distance between the cutters and the surface of the shave head.  And even at max sensitivity it still butchered my neck.<BR>* Takes forever - I have a full beard so all I have to shave is the hollows of my cheeks and my neck.  Just that takes more than three minutes!<BR>* The big fat shaving head makes fine control difficult.  <br />My Braun's shave was almost indistinguishable from that of a high-end blade and it never took more than a minute.

I shave very rarely (once every 3 to 4 weeks).  Consequently, my shavers have to mow through a jungle at that time.

Granted it takes a while to get through the growth, but I truly appreciate the &quot;Linear Motor&quot; feature, which ensures that the razor does not slow down in direct relationship to the thickness of the beard.  The speed is fast and it remains constant! As long as there is power left, which is conveniently displayed with LED lights, the shaver works its way through and I get a very close shave.  Guess if I shaved more often, I would appreciate this product even more!

The razor also comes with a high quality leather travel bag.<br />Whether it is worth [money] over the base model is a good question.  One must also factor in the fact that the base model doesn't even have a low batter indicator!  The Spectra 8894x does have such a feature, as well as a clean razor and replace razor heads indicator.  There is no choice in my opinion, this is definately the Spectra model to own.	2002-10-12

It worked well for 2 1/2 year and then the rechargeable cell (accu) went bad.  Now it only holds power for about 5 minutes of shaving (even after a complete discharge/charge cycle).<br />Otherwise, this model shaved very well (not Braun's best yet) with the and Flex integral head.<br />I replaced this model with a 6520.  The 6520 has the same head/foils but is larger, with a 6W rating (compared to the 5416's 5W).  The result is a faster oscillation rate on the 6520 and less propensity to bogging down on 2 day stubble (i have a hard beard).  The 6520 is a bit bulkier in the hand but it works noticeably better and faster (i shaved 40% of my shaving time).<br />While the 5416 has been a good unit (although shorter lived than what i got accustomed to with Braun shavers in the last 20 years), the 6520 outperforms it hands down.  <br />If you can find the 6520 still, it is worth the additional expense for better perfomance you will appreciate every day	2002-10-11

I took the scale, my original receipt and the warranty card back to [the store] today. They will not replace either battery or scale as they only warranty products for 30 days. They said to send it back to Taylor.<br />I went to Taylor's website for help, but while they have a site, there is no customer service or even email available there. So I got out the owners booklet to find out how to contact them. The warranty booklet, while mentioning the \\"lifetime of operation\\" you should get from a lithium battery, makes no mention of any warranty coverage for batteries that do not last a \\"lifetime.\\"<br />I got the distinct impression that they know full well that the battery may not last a \\"lifetime\\" as 3/4 of one page in the owner's booklet is about the low battery signal, what battery to buy to replace it and how to install the new battery. Why would this be needed if the battery really did last a \\"lifetime?\\"<br />This scale was more expensive than other digital scales and I willingly paid that for a \\"lifetime\\" battery. But knowing now that the lithium battery is not going to last any longer than a regular battery, I do not feel the added cost is worth it.

I was getting a close shave, but that was a problem for my skin. I would get razor burn on my neck if the shave was too close. I decided to give electric razors a try back in June. I started with the Remington Microscreen I because it was cheap. It gave an OK shave and without the razor burn. I also took off my full grown beard of 6 months and carved it down to a goatee with a mustache (fumanchoo). The electric razor wasn't powerful enough to tackle wiskers longer than a couple days growth, so maintaining my goatee was easy. However, I wanted to upgrade, so after a month I traded it in for a Remington Microscreen 3 and was even more pleased by the performance of this model.<br />This razor cuts closer than the Microscreen I because it has 3 blades as opposed to it's predecessor's 1 blade. And, like the Microscreen I, it does not cause razor burn. It is functional as a mustache/beard trimmer also and is great for maintaining a shaped goatee. I use baby powder before I shave because Remington says that this will smooth the skin and the razor will cut better. However, it is possible to shave with this without prepping the skin.<BR>The downs are that it is a bit noisy and that it can only shave with the rechargeable battery...when the battery dies you have to recharge for 5 minutes to finish shaving rather than just plugging it in. However, a full charge of 16 hours will last for a good week.<br />The ups are that it shaves close without leaving razor burn. It's also great for maintaining a beard/mustache.<br />I would definitely recommend the Remington Microscreen 3 to a friend!!	2002-10-07

I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.<br />After two weeks of use I can say this is a very accurate scale.  This scale weighs to .2 pound resolution which is close to 0.1 percent of your typical body mass.  Because its so accurate even slight movement (swaying, muscle movement) while on the scale can cause some variation hence you can expect to see a +- .2 variation from one weighing to the next.  That's not really a problem for me and don't be deterred thinking the scale is inaccurate.  If you stand very still you'll see the same value time after time (until you loose or gain weight of your own accord!).<br />I can't really comment on the body fat measurement since I've never had a third party measurement to compare with.  I've experienced about a 5-10% variation either way between successive measurements.  I suspect its not getting my feet accurately on the pads or moisture.  However that accuracy is within the daily variation you'll see anyway from varying water levels in your body.  Just measure at the same time of day and keep a record and you should be able to detect a steady change if you're dieting or doing something else that will change your body fat.<br />The scale has two kick buttons at the front which allow you to select from two body profiles.  The profile includes your height, body type (normal/athletic) and gender.  The profile only affects your body fat measurement anyone can wiegh themselves - they just have to know to kick one of the switches first to turn on the scale.  After measurements stabalize you can step off the scale and they will flash for several seconds - this allows those vision problems (I can't read the figures without my glasses - but they are plenty big enough to see with them) to stoop down and take a close look.  <br />This scale uses 4 AA batteries (included) so no expensive lithiums to buy and you could even use rechargeables if you really wanted.  I've no idea how long they last, I'll update this review if they ever run out.<br />Unlike the Health-o-meter I've had no problems with tipping on this scale, it does not have separate feet - the base sits directly on the floor.<br />In short - a functional, well designed and accurate digital scale, well worth the purchase price.	2002-10-04

I've only compared it to four other scales, but it is the same with all four.    One thing I've noticed from reading reviews for many different scales is that digital scales (at least those made by Taylor) are for the most part very consistent, even if they are wrong. So I guess if this is no big deal, it's a great scale.     It's easy to use, it always functions, and it hasn't broken after three years. It gives me consistent results even if I move it to different surfaces. Many times I have weighed myself repeatedly, just to see, and sometimes I have moved the scale to different surfaces. The instructions suggest that different surfaces will produce different measurements, but in my case it makes no difference.    Another review here says that to get the most accurate readings, you should weigh yourself holding something 5 lbs or more first, then weigh without it for an untampered weight (to see more info/details about this, see the other review as it's a lot to replicate here). Basically the reviewer says that because the scale is actually not very accurate and sensitive, the scale uses software to just show the most recent weight (i.e. not necessarily what you weigh) until something weighs significantly/noticeably different to the scale (at least 1.2 lbs in this case). I tested my scale with and without the \\"workaround\\" and it really makes no difference for me. I get the same weight for the same object (me, or me plus heavy stuff) repeatedly, even when I switch back and forth.     The battery still works. My understanding, too, is that the battery should last a lifetime (enough uses to last many years if used once a day). I've moved five or six times with the scale, and it's held up just fine.	2002-09-30

QUALITY: I have been using my OLD Norelco razor for almost 12 years. Since I excercise the batteries \\"correctly\\" (full discharge->full charge) they have lasted up until now. I don't baby it, and I have only had to replace the cutting heads a few times. The old Norelco was built like a tank and has been reliable and DURABLE. I recently started looking for a replacement and figured that if the new razor lasts only half as long, even $$$ is money well spent.<BR> Upon opening the box, i was disappointed in several minor ways:<BR> 1) Can Norelco PLEASE learn \\"green\\" packaging? There is far more blow-molded plastic than necessary. The razor is about 16X the volume of the package.<BR> 2) The AC adapter has \\"grown\\" compared to the old model. It now has a small wall-wart. The older models used to be a simple plug into the wall. This could be annoying if I lose the special adapter. <BR> 3) The travel bag is an obnoxiuos light gray with a hint of lavendar, and larger than necessary. Simply not the most masculine of travel bags.<BR> 4) The fairly symmetrical head has a slightly asymmetrical clear plastic cover with no good directionality indicator. This lack of a poke-a-yoke means I'm gonna throw it out soon and go without it. Oh, and it doesn't stay on all that tight, either.<BR> 5) After first use, I did a \\"practice\\" clean. This worked fine until I gave it a minor shake dry....the head fell off! Easy to put back on (it's a simple metal leaf-spring), but funny nonetheless. C'mon Norelco....this is a \\"MAN's\\" product.<BR> <br /> HOWEVER-> <BR> 1+ It definitely gives a much closer shave than my old NORELCO, and quickly!<BR> 2+ It holds a lot of charge<BR> 3+ (Like my old unit) it has the sensitivity adjustment<BR> 4+ Even on \\"Normal\\" sensitivity, it doesn't pinch<BR> my neck like the older model did.<BR> 5+ The trimmer works really well.<BR> 6+ The AC adapter cord stretches to 6ft easily.<BR>OVERALL RATING: 4 stars. Although it doesn't feel like the tank my old unit was, this isdefinitely a top notch razor. I would have given it 5 stars except for the clear plastic cover.  I plan on getting a good 5 years of daily shaves out of this one. WELL WORTH THE MONEY and i'm glad I bought it.	2002-09-28

A godsend for sensitive skin	I have very sensitive skin and have tried numerous methods of shaving over the years.  Blades caused pain and rashes.  The Braun 5520 that I just retired never seemed to shave my neck hairs effectively even after numerous passes.  The Norelco 8894 XL does a superior job of shaving all areas of my face with minimal effort.  It has numerous settings for normal to sensitive skin.  I began with the normal setting, and my sensitive skin hasn't had a problem.  The price of this razor represents a seemingly pricey investment, but is well worth it as shaving is a daily, inescapable activity.  Washing the blades under tap water also seems much easier, and cheaper, than using special cartridges and cleaning methods required by the new top-of-the-line Braun.  The time remaining display lets you know how much time remains, and is far superior to a suddenly blinking light letting you know your razor is dead as you began your shave as you rush out the door before that important meeting that I had with the Braun.  Electric razor technology has improved considerably, and this is a great next step.	2002-09-25

This is the best yet for a close shave. I pre-shave with a conventional triple blade razor with cream (gets rid of the overgrowth) and use Skintimate shaving gel (lots better than regular foams and gels) for an incredibly close shave. Only complaint is that Panasonic didn't use a rubberized grip as the plastic gets slippery when wet. Solved with two wide rubber bands (a minor nuisance.) Charger and usage monitor is ...-proof. Cleaning is a snap. Best wet shaver on the market.	2002-09-22

I feel so strongly about this shaver that although I've spent quite a bit at Amazon and other online sites, I've never bothered writing a review until now.  <br />Simply put this is the best electric shaver I've used in my 30+ years of shaving; and I've owned quite a few. I was reluctant to order it sight unseen, but I'm glad I did. It shaves smoother, more comfortably, and quicker than I could have reasonably expected. The battery hold a charge for a ridiculously long period of time.  A feature I especially appreciate is the ability to rinse the heads under runing water.  This alone is almost worth the price of admission. The carrying case is a bit cumbersone but I don't mind. I can't really find any faults worth mentioning.  It's not perfect, but close enough for me.<br />This shaver offers few bells and whistles that don't directly improve shaving quality.  It just shaves great, which is all that matters.	2002-09-21

This shaving machine is a member of the Reflex series that made its advent to the market in 1998 (if I'm not mistaken) . Ever since , there have been a few upgrades to this same basic feature of floating shave heads in the form of the Deluxe Quadra Action , the Deluxe Advantage Wet/Dry and the latest Spectra top of the line .<br />Before purchasing the 5810XL I have done a market survey to come up with the conclusion that these upgrades are too expensive , and do not necessarily worth their higher price tag : Okay , so you can shave your face in the bath , while you're wet . So what ? Why would I want to do that ? Another upgrade is the LCD indication scale that shows the state of the battery (5841XL). It's nice , but paying an additional 20 - 30 bucks for that ? I'm not sure .<br />The only extra cash I would be willing to pay is for better shaving results . In this field the innovations are shaped in the form of the two stage blade system (6891XL and the 6826XL , to name a few versions) and the lotion/gel dispensing system (6756X) that sounds promising but are respectively expensive (at least , for me) . The newest line mentioned above is the over-priced (but maybe well deserved) Spectra line that strikes me as made for rich only .<br />To say a few words about the Reflex system , this is the heart of the machine and it includes three razors that are floating in their place and flexing to enable the closest shave possible , by fitting to the facial contours . As for the 5810's Reflex system performance , it certainly delivers ; I'm experiencing much closer and better shaves than ever (I used a 4681 before and reviewed it as well) , and can sincerely confirm the superiority of this product over its predecessors .<br />By choosing the 5810XL you acquire a durable and trustworthy product that pays . My father has been using one older version for 3 years without any problem whatsoever .	2002-09-08

Of course it's not as good as a blade (no shaver is), but it's a heck of a lot easier and cleaner than lathering up every day.<br />My only minor complaint is that the replacement cartridges are a tad expensive (about ($$$) a month if you self-clean every day... although you certainly don't need to clean it daily).

When sliding the shaver across my face it almost feels like its scratching rather than gliding. It was especially painful when doing the neck and jawline. I blaming the sharp edges on the heads for this lack of comfort. The Norelco Quadra is much more comfortable to use with smooth , well rounded edges on the heads. I feel that it doesn't shave as close as the Norelco but perhaps this is because I didn't give myself time to adjust to it.<br />In all fairness it is solidly built and has a feels plenty powerful. Trimmer is much more effective than the Norelco Quadra. It also can be washed.<br />Pass on this one. Go for the Norelco Quadra.	2002-08-28

The motor on the razor sounded like it was going to go so I decided to try the quadra action because supposedly its better.  Right away I noticed that my shaves took longer using the quadra action because those small holes just took away slots and they really didnt cut anything.  I'd have to go over shaved areas again and again just to get all the stuble.  Today I just became frustrated and took out my old reflex action and voila I was done shaving in 1 minute.  This model is overpriced and not worth it. Sure you can wash it under the tap but the water causes the hair in the chamber to clump up until finally there is just a whole bunch of gunk in there thats very difficult to clean out. My old reflex action was munch better because all I had to do was open it up and the powedered hair just came out.  Save your money.  Get a reflex action instead of this.	2002-08-24

I have 8 more pounds of fat to lose, and then I will start to use this scale to tell me if I'm beefing back up with muscle or fat again. I'm excited about being able to do this, and the scale has made this possible. <br />I don't know how accurate this scale is compared to other types of fat measurement, but who cares. I am very confident that it measures me (you, anyone) very accurately relative to changes over time. My body looks more cut now - and the scale says it should. Likewise, it will tell me that I'm getting softer long before I can see it visually. <br />I've found it best to take a daily measurement at night and average that over a five-day period to get a decent measure of progress.  Then chart it to see how your lean mass and fat mass are changing relative to one-another.  I have a spreadsheet I've developed and I'll send a copy to anyone who wants it. Search me.<br />One thing that keeps it from getting five stars is that it allows only two settings - normal and athlete. But, according to the manufacturer, the Athlete setting requires a level of activity that only a professional athlete at the height of their season would could actually hit.  I occasionally switch mine from normal to athlete to see how my measurement differs, and it differs very significantly. Therefore I know one, or both measurements are not quite the true picture. I just keep mine on normal, though I work out most every day.  It's all relative - but I wish they had a \\"Moderate Athlete\\" setting that let us regular gym goers get a reading in between the other two. I also don't know exactly how age affects things, but this unit does not take that into account.<br />Still, I'm very glad I have it, and wouldn't want to fight the battle of the bulge without it again.	2002-08-22

As a stiff foil shaver, it does not contour around bony areas, such as the chin, as well as the floating, rotating heads on the Norelco.<BR>3.  The shaver leaves the stubbles of your beard in your sink, making for a messy daily clean-up.<br />I had high expectations with Panasonic's claim of such high RPM's of blade movement. Unfortunately, the quality of the shave is limited by the foil design. Even higher RPM's would not fix its weaknesses.	2002-08-14

The large two line digital display is big enough to see even without my glasses.  The programming is super simple, 5 minutes or less.

The color on this model is actually an eggshell white, not gray as pictured...gray is for the \\"athletic\\" version available elsewhere.  Before purchasing this scale, I did a lot of research through various sources and this one won out hands-down.  I had never heard of Tanita prior, but they have an extensive line of precision weight equipment for home use, medical professions and manufacturing.  I also read customer reviews from other websites and this scale comes with high recommendations.  Tanita has a good website where you can clearly compare features from one model to the next to make sure you get a model that is going to suit your needs.

I need to start by saying that I've been a electric razor hater my entire life.  Over the years I've been given a Braun, a Norelco (you know, Santa skiing down the hill) and a Remington.  They are all sitting in my bathroom cupboard collecting dust.<br />I grew to love the Mach 3.  It reduced cuts and gave me a close shave.  I was amazed because I have a tough beard and a terrible shaving technique.  My biggest problem was ingrown hairs and razor bumps (man, they hurt!)<br />I saw the reviews of the Panasonic ES8003W and thought &quot;why not give it a try?&quot;  Well, I'm sold on electric shaving now!  Here's why:<br />1) A close shave - probably still not as close as a blade but pretty darn close.<br />2) Easy touchups - I'm getting ready to go out and don't feel like washing, lathering, shaving and styptic penciling.<br />3) Easy to clean - just run it under hot water.<br />4) No ingrown hairs! - haven't had one since starting to use the Panasonic.<br />5) I like the noise it makes - you can tell by the sound when you're done with an area...sounds silly but it's true!<br />Here are my suggestions for getting the best shave with the Panasonic:<br />1) Wash your face first with a good face soap (I use Neutrogena &quot;Oil-Free Acne Wash&quot;) and hot water.  I still haven't been able to master shaving in the shower - I feel it wastes water and I'm always afraid I'll shave off my moustache.<br />2) Use Neutrogena Men &quot;Skin Clearing Shave Cream&quot;.  I've tried several (the instruction booklet suggests foam but I didn't like it as much) and found that it works the best for me.<br />3) Give it 30 days.  It takes that long for your beard and skin to adjust to the new method.<br />4) Be prepared for some pain.  While your skin adjusts, try using Neutrogena Men &quot;Razor Defense Face Lotion&quot; after shaving.<br />All the Neutrogena products I've mentioned are available at Drugstore.com (no, I don't work for Neutrogena nor Drugstore.com and I haven't done Investment Banking for either of them...I do own Drugstore.com stock in my IRA - you know, full-disclosure!)for either of them...I do own Drugstore.com stock in my IRA - you know, full-disclosure!)	2002-07-20

I use the rotary blades to trim my beard, and the beard trimmer is very handy.  This is my fourth electric razor, and by far this is the best one because it cleans easily by placing it under running water.  It's about time that they made a razor that could handle that.  The charge time is very long, over two weeks of daily use.  Great product!  It is worth the extra money.	2002-07-04

I used Braun Flex Integra for about 5 years, until the capacity of the battery started decreasing, and I decided that its time to get a new shaver. I followed positive recommmendations on Amazon and bought Panasonic 8066. I must say that I was greatly impressed - no, wrong word - shocked by the difference! Not only it shaves much faster, the closeness of the shave is amazing. Panasonic feels in comparison with my old Braun like a state-of-the-art technology against a stone age device. With Braun, I was always slightly undershaved, it could not get even close to the performance of a traditional razor. A one minute shave with the Panasonic brought my face to the state which I could only dream about in the last five years. Most amazingly, 9 hours after the shave I was still shaved cleaner than what I got used to end up after a shave with Braun! What can I say - viva Panasonic, and thanks to those Amazon reviewers who suggested that this shaver is the best you can get!	2002-07-02

The shave is close and the razor allows manuverability without the risk of cuts.  I have had my system for over two years; I replace the cartridge every three months--this task is easy to accomplish--just remove the old one and replace with a new one.  However, I am disappointed that my shaving foil has developed a large hole and now must be replaced--as this is the first time I am doing this and being that I have used the razor system for quite a while, I am unable to comment on just how often I will have to replace this foil--hopefully it will be the 18 months the manufacturer suggests.  If I have another complaint it would be the lack of portability of the entire system.  If I want to take the razor on vacation, I supposedly could do without cleaning for the extent of my trip, but this defeats the purpose of the system.  I like and appreciate the fact that the shave is so good due to the constant cleaning.  Braun should come up with some kind of portable base that allows cleaning while on vacation without having to haul the entire thing and up the possibility that the spring base will eventually break.	2002-07-02

When you have a beard there is no doubt that it is a chore to keep in shape.  In the past I have tried the beard trimmer attachements on regular shavers but they just don't cut it.<br />This is a product that makes short work of any beard.  Now, my hair is thicker than most, so it takes power to pull through without pulling at the hair.  This little baby can make short work of the beard even when it is matted with dried in barbecue sauce and chilli dog.  However, it's not so good with chewing gum.  For that I recommend you stick to a scissors, cause the heads get all fugged up with pink gunge and it takes a lot of pickin to get it all out.  I guess guys with beards should stop blowing bubble gum!<br />I find this little engine useful for all manner of clipping.  When the kids get head lice all you need to do is whip off all their hair and hey presto, no more problem.<br />The wife even uses it (no not under her arms - she's natural) to trim the poodle and get all the crappy hair off its backside.<br />Whatever job you have to do with hair, from ear trimming to toe shaving, you can't go wrong with this little beauty.  But it's no good for shearing sheep.	2002-06-28

This shaving machine is a member of the Reflex series that made its advent to the market in 1998 (if I'm not mistaken) . Ever since there have been few upgrades to this same basic feature , of floating shave heads , in the form of the Deluxe Quadra Action and the Deluxe Advantage Wet/Dry .<br />Before purchasing the 5811XL I have done a market survey to come up with the conclusion that these upgrades are too expensive , and do not necessarily worth their higher price tag : Okay , so you can shave your face in the bath , while you're wet . So what ? Why would I want to do that ? Another upgrade is the LCD indication scale that shows the state of the battery (5841XL). It's nice , but paying an additional 20 - 30 bucks for that ?! The only extra cash I would be willing to pay is for better shaving results . In this field the innovations are shaped in the form of the newest two stage blade system (6891XL and the 6826XL)  and the lotion/gel dispensing system (6756X)that sounds promising but are way too expensive (at least , for me).<br /><br />To say a few word on the Reflex system , this is the heart of the machine , and it includes three razors that are floating in their place and flexing to enable the closest shave possible , by fitting to the facial contours . As for the 5811's Reflex system performance , it certainly delivers ; I'm experiencing much closer and better shaves than ever (I used a 4681 before and reviewed it as well) , and can sincerely confirm the superiority of this product over its predecessors .<br />Spend [money] for a durable and trustworthy product that pays . My father has been using  one older version for 3 years without any problem whatsoever .	2002-06-18

I had gotten a similar model of this electric shaver from my father , before I drafted to the army in 1996 . It had served me faithfully for six years , without having to replace the battery (!) , until it was time to substitute the shaving heads that finished their life span . During that six years , I believe in 1998 , Norelco introduced the latest development in the field of shaving - the Reflex series - in which each razor was floating in its place to enable the closest shave possible by fitting to the facial contours . Ever since , I waited to get my hands on one of these nice machines , a wait that ended three month ago when I finally bought the Norelco 5811XL (you can check out my Norelco 5811XL review for more details) .<br />Today , I can honestly say that the Norelco 4681 is a long bygone machine ; I am so satisfied with the 5811's shaving outcome that the time I spent shaving with the 4681 seems like a pre-historic era . I've always had problems shaving my neck and the lower areas of my chin using the 4601 , these problems don't exist anymore with the 5811 . But the comparison between the two is definitely unjust - the 5811 is in another league ; The Reflex mechanism does the difference , and the newer line of instruments is unparalleled to any of its predecessors . other than that , the machines differ mostly in styling , but that single upgrade is everything . . .<br />I'm aware to the fact that the 5811 has a 50% higher price tag . Nevertheless , in the long run and considering the real improvement in the shaving results , it pays . I would recommend this shaving machine only if you cannot spend the extra 30 bucks right now .	2002-06-18

I've had this shaver for several months now and am very impressed with its performance.  I don't know if it's the \\"Quardra Action\\" or not, but it consistently gives a comfortable, smooth shave.  Moreover, it's quieter, gives a closer shave, and is more comfortable to hold compared to more moderately priced shavers.  The Norelco 6826XL is also easier to clean: Shake it out in the trash, then rinse under tap water.  Occasionally, you might want to manually clean the cutters with the included brush.<br />The Norelco recharges quickly (a few hours for full recharging, several minutes for a quick one), has a nice solid feeling, and is angled for a more ergonomic experience.  Furthermore, the money-back guarantee appears to be the real thing; you can't lose on this one. The shaver stops fairly soon when the battery is almost used-up; there's really no need for the more expensive models that have a charge indicator light.<br />Face it, shaving is subjective, and will depend a lot on your preferences, the contours of your face, and the characteristics of your hair.  However, I have been very pleased with the Norelco and recommend it highly--I think the comfort, performance, construction, ease of cleaning, and relatively quiet noise level justify its price.	2002-06-17

The Heat mode is good and does warm the skin, but I would have liked it a bit hotter. <BR> The only drawback I have found is when giving a massage with this machine one must watch the wing bones and other hard protruding bones as it will bounce and be somewhat annoying, as with any other massage unit one must watch his/her hair as it is a machine and can grab it.

I've used electric shavers for the past 20 years: Remington, Norelco, and, Braun (the longest).  This ES8003 is an amazing upgrade from my Braun, and even more amazing when (actually) shaving wet.<br />I believe that a number of the negative comments around the ES8003 (or for that matter, any electric shavers), are coming from newbies (to the electric shaving world).  It really is a different skill-set to learn how to shave close, effectively, and efficiently with an electric shaver.  (Frankly, the fastest, closest shave comes from a non-electric shave;  however, my &quot;morning&quot; coordination and 'hurried/busy' shower routine, and lack of patience, typically results in too-many nicks with a non-electric blade.)   It took a few days for my skin to acclimate to the Panasonic, from a Braun shaver.<br />The main problem with a Braun is you need a completely &quot;dry&quot; face:  this means no-shaving until 30-min post-shower.  No big deal, just a change in routine.<br />The Pansonic/ES8003, you can shave dry right out of the shower.  However, I tried it with shaving-gel and the results (truly) are amazing.  (I tried it in the shower, but I prefer access to a mirror whilst shaving, and, I'm near-sighted which makes it difficult in a shower wearing contacts/glasses.)   Finally, since it's a dry/wet shaver, cleanup is a breeze:  you just rinse it out under the water.<br />I considered the Braun 5775 as my next shaver, and I'm glad I bought this Panasonic instead.  (No messy cleaning solution hassle, which Braun forces you to deal with too!)	2002-06-12

It's very convenient, and much faster to shave with this versus a regular blade, but the shave is definitely not as close.  My first reaction was to try and stretch and prod my face to get the shave to be as close as possible, but it's pretty much a waste of time.  The good news is there was no irritation with this razor at all.<br />In comparison with the norelco quadra-action lift-and-cut razor, which I have also used, the norelco gives a much closer shave however is a little rough on my face.  The nape of my neck never really got adjusted to the norelco even after 30 days of use.  However the panasonic was much faster at completing the shave as the norelco needed many more passes to pick up all of the hairs.	2002-06-12

It charges in less than an hour and works whether my face is wet or dry. A real plus for me since I sweat at the gym and I like to use it there. I would recommend it to all of you whould also want use it for this purpose. The only complaint is that there is no real carrying case, but a velvety string bag that comes with it. That's why it gets a 4 and not a 5 star...	2002-06-12

Several months ago I decided it was time to upgrade my electric shaver.  It was time to buy new blades anyway, and the model I was using was at least 6 years old.

My six year old shaver was a Norelco, and since I had no real problems with it I decided to go with Norelco once again.<br />I chose \\"Quadra Action\\" because the two stage process of slots for long hairs and holes for short hairs made sense.

I think I have owned 4 in that time.  They are the best...being able to use it in the shower, with shaving cream or what have you, and to get such a close shave! The main reason I have had to replace them is because the rechargable batteries just wear out...this happened more with the older models because battery technology hadn't improved to what it is today.<br />However, one I had to replace because of electronic failure.  It was over a year old so I didn't hassle with warranties, but the next model I got revealed the problem for me.  It was directly related to where I was leaving it in the shower.  Our shower has a little ledge, and I will lay the shaver there while I finish my shower.  I used to leave the shaver there all the time, so that I could use it for many days on a single charge and run the battery completely down (older battery types appreciated this; they would last longer).  This proved to be the problem...water was getting trapped under the shaver that I was unaware of.  It wasn't much water, but it was enough to not dry out by the next morning. After a few months of this, it started to act funny, and I realized that water must be seeping inside of the casing, and that the old shaver must have shorted from water inside of it.  I changed my habits and now keep the shaver in the charger when not in use so it can stand up and properly dry out (it has a newer battery which doesn't care about daily charges anyway), and I have not had a problem since.  My current model I have had for 2 years now, I am still using it in the shower daily, and it is still going strong!  Interestingly enough, I pulled the old one out of the drawer the other day, and it was working again...must have finally dried out :-)<br />I don't claim that this is *the* reason why the previous user's units were failing, but this has been my experience.  I would highly recommend these shavers, worth every penny!  (Just don't drop it and damage the foil...it's not cheap to replace).	2002-06-03

There is quite a bit of adjustment to the strength and character of the thumps, but I found the effect neither therapeutic nor relaxing, just curious.<br />I could get the kneading to cover the upper part of my neck or the lower part by turning the control knob, but for someone taller or shorter, the coverage would be limited. The speed control for the kneading doesn't really change the speed that much. The neck kneading nodes are made of rather hard plastic, and in my case they seemed too narrow apart (and there is no adjustment for width), so after just a few minutes it was more painful than relaxing.  Then it started squeaking intermittently.<br />Within an hour of receiving the massager I decided to return it.	2002-06-02

I'm a blade guy myself, but on the weekends, I often use this Norelco. It replaced a Braun I had used similarly for years, and I prefer the Norelco to the Braun for a closer shave. This unit is also easier to clean and recharges more quickly. In addition, it is quieter. The drawback is that it is bulkier, but that's not a major issue. It holds it's charge for no less than 30 minutes of shaving. What really does amaze me is that my battery operated Braun (model 370) that I keep in my car is almost as good, and lots cheaper.	2002-06-02

Since I'm a &quot;big guy&quot; who is into both exercise (90minutes minimum per workout, 5 days a week), and also managing my pesky metabolism to avoid weight gain, this scale was a must. It works consistently, although there is a little 'play' in the major increments (i.e., 150, 200, 250, etc.) so you have to make sure you seat that unit each time (I usually set and push to right slightly to make sure it's in the same spot). I finally wore mine out (it started to rust a little from being in the bathroom by the shower...). I liked this one so much, I'm today ordering its big brother &quot;physician&quot; (and not putting it by the shower!). Reasons to buy? Accuracy versus the &quot;step on&quot; springy kind if you're a muscle guy, or want to track weight loss as accurately as possible -- i.e., when you're trying to lose 2 lbs in a week, and your scale &quot;floats&quot; by 2 lbs either way, then you can't track properly your actual weight or track loss/gain in small increments like 1/2-lb.

I use the wet/dry shaver on a daily basis in the shower, and am now on my fourth Panasonic ES8003W in the last two years.  The reason:  the electronics of the device fail within 6 months of usage.  I cannot determine why, nor, apparently, can the good folks at Panasonic.  Panasonic has replaced each 6-month-old defective model I return to them with a new one, which I appreciate.  But it also makes me suspicious that Panasonic knows this shaver is not durable, perhaps because it is not properly designed to tolerate daily shower use (and I'm not talking about submersing it in water).<br />I wish it was a more durable product, because it provides a great shave.  My fourth model just broke, exhibiting similar 6-month electronics failures, and I am at a loss as to what to replace it with.	2002-05-18

About fives years ago, I bought a Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver . It's very good, but there was something wrong with the battery half a year ago. So I had to buy a new one_Norelco 6886XL. Althought It's not bad, I don't like it. It's too big and not convenient for travelling. Specially, I don't like the way it works, and the speed of rotation seems too slowly-just like run out of power immediately. So I have to find a new one instead, even if it's not broken,<br />When I had a glance on Bruan 7570 by accident. I believe it's the shaver I've been looking for.It's perfect design,specially the pattern and the function. And the battery life is longer than the 6886XL. I think there is no need to be worried about it's effectiveness after I read the other customer reviews listed here.<br />The only thing I worried about is the Clean%Charge.

After doing a good amount of research, it was clear that this Norelco was the best rotary shaver to date, while the braun syncro was deemed to be the best foil shaver.  I had never used an electric before, so which style to choose remained a mystery.<br />I purchased BOTH shavers, since both come with money back guaratees if you are not satisfied (Norelco w/ 60 days and Braun w/ 30 days).  I divided my face in two over a few weeks, and used both machines, on either side of my face, to gauge how well each did its job.  <br />Here is what I was able to conclude:<BR>- For my face, the Braun was, without a doubt, closer.  It was almost no different from a perfect Mach 3 shave.<br />- I had a tough time doing under my jaw with both shavers, especially the area right underneath your mouth.  Overall, however, the Braun was better at this too, but required several well aimed passes.  Don't ever think of shaving w/o a mirror.<br />- The Braun gets hotter as you are using it.  The norelco tends to remain cool, which helps limit burning and/or irritation.<br />- The Norelco's cleaning is unbeatable - right under the tap; I haven't had to change the Braun's catridge yet, but I'm sure it's coming up soon.<br />- Norelco full charge = approx 35 min; Braun full charge = 50 min.<br />- Norelco is slightly more quieter and vibrates less, which I assume is simply due to the nature of the rotating heads.<br />After doing this, I concluded that closeness is most important, so I went with the Braun.  It worked best for my face, and I'm pretty sure that on any face it'll be closer.  Keep it mind that panasonic makes top of the line &quot;Linear&quot; shavers, but it didn't have a money back guarantee and i wasn't in the mood to divide my face into 1/3 instead of 1/2.  I have no clue how a linear stacksup to these two types.<br />Hope this helps.	2002-04-24

The result I get by lathering up with hand soap and then shaving with the Linear is incredible... just as close if not closer than what I was getting with the Mach 3.  There were a couple of surprises, though.  I thought it would be quicker and gentler than a razor.  As it turns out, it takes me about the same time to shave with this aggressive shaver that leaves your skin begging for a delightful (slightly painful) splash of aftershave.  For those of you who don't think you can get as close a shave with an electric, the Linear deserves a shot at proving you wrong.	2002-04-20

I purchased the GF-200 first but soon returned it.  The GF-200 is an older model that contains a fan, which, after working silently for four or five days only, became noisy.  Slant Fin indicated the motor should not be making noise, that the unit must have been dropped in transit, and that Slant Fin or the retailer would replace the unit for me.  I decided to return the GF-200 to the retailer, and purchase the GF-300 instead because the GF-300 has no motor to go bad.

Is this their strategy for offering the unit at a bargain basement price? In addition, it's a poor design to have to replace the entire 3\\" brush attachment. Why didn't they design it so that you could just pop in a new brush on the tip of the head? Environmentally, quite a faux pas. Other than that gripe, the toothbrush is like others have stated: your teeth feel cleaner and you feel like you paid better attention to the task instead of mindlessly bouncing a regular toothbrush around the inside of your mouth. It's easy to develop a methodical procedure that ensures that all tooth surfaces get some attention.	2002-04-04

I shouldn't have.  The shave that I get from the Braun is much less smooth than from the Norelco (although a regular safety razor like a Mach 3 beats them both by a decent margin, regardless of what the ads say).  This one has a fancy electronic cleaning system that requires buying a cleaning cartridge every month or so.  It still doesn't seem to be any cleaner than the Norelco, which just needs to be washed.  I find myself having to shave the same areas of my face over and over and over to get a semi-reasonable shave.  Trust me, just buy the 6885XL instead, and you most likely won't be disappointed.  It's a much better razor.	2002-03-27

It did a much better job than any Norelco I had used previously. I really enjoyed shaving with Braun. However, the weak spot of this shaver was the battery. It developed a \\"memory\\" despite the fact that I periodically discharged it completely in accordance with Braun's instructions. So as time went on, I had to recharge the battery more often. It finally died after two years of use. The battery is not replaceable so when it goes, so does the razor. Additionally, Braun recommends replacing the cutter and foil every 18 months.

I always use it wet, with shaving oil (and sometimes gel).<br />Since I just started with electric shaving, I'm going to give it a little while longer for my skill to improve, and for my skin to adjust.

In searching for a replacement, I decided to work backward, checking to see what replacement blades were available WHERE, and at what price . . . and then shopping for the shavers that use the replacement blades that were easier and cheaper to obtain.  But another requirement I had for the shaver itself is that it had to be easy to clean.<br />That's how I ended up choosing the Remington MS3-1000.  The replacement foils/blades are easy and cheap to obtain, and the packaging advertised that you could clean the shaver by running it under the tap.<br />The MS3-1000 itself is a very well made product, that I'm sure will last a long time.  Battery life is exceptional, easily lasting well over a week.  It is also easy to use, as far as shaving goes.<br />Cleaning the MS3-1000 isn't as easy as I thought it would be.  While both the foils and cutters can be run under the tap, Remington advises cleaning the cutters with a brush, and seems to discourage running the cutters under the tap to clean them.  Actually, the user's manual kind of contradicts itself on this issue.  On the one hand, it says cleaning the cutters under running water is OK, but on the other hand it says not to immerse the shaver in water, leading me to believe that it's probably not a good idea to rinse the cutters under the tap, unless you remove them from the shaver first (which would be a pain if you had to do THAT every time you shave).  So at first I tried to rinse the foils and -brush- the cutters clean.  But the cleaning brush Remington includes is hard to use on the cutters.  The bristles of the cleaning brush are so soft that they easily get caught in the cutters while you are trying to clean the shaver.  This makes cleaning the cutters with the brush difficult.<br />As far as shaving goes, the MS3-1000 works good, but doesNOT shave as close as Panasonic foil type shavers and Norelco rotary type shavers that I've used in the past.  This is not just noticeable right after shaving, but also at the end of the day, when I have more (late day) stubble than I'm used to.<br />Overall, the MS3-1000 is a good shaver for the price.  I'm used to shavers that are a bit easier to clean and offer a closer shave, but I'd gladly settle for this Remington model that offers adequate performance in a package that isn't too tough to clean or find replacement blades for.	2002-02-10

I used to run 6 miles a day, 5 days a week. I had a great pair of expensive running shoes with gel inserts and a heel protector.  But after shin splints, blisters, and 500 miles on my shoes, I \\"ran\\" into some major foot pain.  Long story, but suffice it to say, I had no choice but to stop running because of my high-arched overpronating feet.<br />Now I've found these and though I will never run that much again, (for various reasons, but hey--NEVER SAY NEVER, right?) I will definitely give it a try as part of a cross-training program along with weight-lifting, low-impact aerobics, Yoga, and a bit of Tai Chi.  Oh, and playing with my toddler! Ha.<br />These inserts are the best I've tried and believe me, I have tried A LOT.  Great for your running shoes or any shoes, especially if you have a high arch.  Don't know if you have a high arch? Here's a quick 'n easy test for ya: when you step out of the shower/bath step onto the bare floor, look at your footprint.  If there is a very narrow place in the middle, you have a high arch and NEED THESE! Why suffer with pain when this will solve it?<br />Get back into being active.  Run, racewalk, whatever makes you happy.  These inserts will help make it fun because you won't have the pain.  Also, I have had lower back pain since I was 18 and since I have been wearing these daily and practicing Yoga, it has decreased significantly. I give these inserts a high recommendation.	2002-02-05

Not anymore. I have experienced the same thing over and over. The shaves are not close enough. With a regular razor, I can shave before going to bed and by 5 pm the next day my face looks more recently shaved than if I had used a Norelco that same morning! The fact that these Norelco shavers don't shave as close as a razor means that you have to go over the same spot over and over resulting in razor burns. I think this is the reason that Norelco has come up with different rotating heads such as Double Action, Micro Action, Reflex Action and now Quadra Action. Another thing that makes these Quadra Action shavers less appealing is the fact that replacement heads cost a whopping 33% more than the previous models. If you have never used a Norelco shaver before, I would recommend a less expensive model so in case you experience the same thing I have, you will have wasted less money.	2002-02-03

I managed to get this on sale, but to be honest I would have been happy paying more...<br />As weight scales go, it's more accurate than the average bathroom unit. Most scales seem to fluctuate anywhere from 3-5 pounds each time you step on them after only a minute.<br />I was surprised at how accurate the body fat measurement was. I purchased this not expecting a true reading, but rather just to have something that would allow me to see if my fat content was rising, maintaining, or lowering.<br />Although I have been strongly active for years, I decided in November to make a real commitment towards pushing my athletic ability to the best it could be at my age (31). Part of this was getting my body fat content measured in the tank test, currently the most accurate method used by sports physicians.<br />My scale arrived in the mail before I my scheduled appointment for the tank test. Would that I had known beforehand how accurate the scale was -- measuring myself only 1 hour before my appointment, the scale gave a reading that was only 0.5% off of the results of my tank test. One hour after getting home, I checked the scale again, this time the scale gave me the same reading.<br />It should be noted that if you are serious about your fitness, I would still recommend the tank test as you learn a lot about your body's overall composition and have the opportunity to review your results with a physician.<br />Readout is large enough and easy to read. A friend commented that the readout has no backlight, and although this is true I don't see why I'd want to see my weight and fat percentage in the dark.<br />The unit also ships with plastic feet that can be mounted on the bottom of the unit for use on carpeting up to 1\\" thick. For me this was a nice bonus as I prefer to use this scale where my workout equipment is (carpeting), rather than the bathroom.<br />Overall a fantastic unit and a must-have if you're serious about improving or maintaining your physical conditioning.	2002-01-28

I shaved with a blade for 23 years (new airport security rules eliminating sharp items in carry-ons caused me to try this shaver).  When I first started shaving, I tried an electic foil razor, but it left me shaver burned and I never tried again until recently purchasing this shaver.<br />This is truly an example of how technology over more than two decades has improved.  This shaver provides a close shave without the burn, and the automatic cleaning system works exceptionally well.  I couldn't even match the performance of the automated cleaning system when performing the exercise manually with the supplied brush.  No patience, I guess.<br />I still haven't decided whether to clean daily or less frequently even after referencing the other reviews on this site.  I am committed to performing the cleanings at the frequency needed to keep the quality of the shave at the same level that it is now, but I do not think this is daily even with the limited experience that I have had to this point.<br />As the instruction manual suggests, it is best to shave against the grain of the whiskers.  While this is intuitively obvious, I believe blade shaving is a little more forgiving when not actually following the grain.  The Braun will audibly give you a good indication of whether you are actually against the grain by whether you hear the hairs being shaven or not.  If you know you are not clean-shaven in a region, try a different angle to shaving until you &quot;hear&quot; the Braun performing the cutting.  With some time, you will come to know the &quot;contour&quot; of the grain on your face and shaving with the Braun will be as natural as shaving with a blade but with even better performance.	2002-01-21

I received this for Christmas, and I first used it without the attachments, so I felt it was nothing special.  I also did not like the fact that it does not have a line to let you know how much water to put inside.  When you turn the unit on and the bubbles start if it has too much water it makes a mess.<br />Then I got smart and decided to pull out the accessories.  The pumice stone is nice.  When you use your foot to apply pressure to the stone it starts to spin by itself, all of the attachments are motorized.  The infrared light was relaxing.  Overall I like the product, the manufacturer could make some improvements, lower the volume a little and it would have received 5 stars.	2002-01-21

My face would hurt all over after using the Norelco.  WIth the Braun, my face never hurts afterwards, even if I have to go over an area multiple times to get some stray hair that won't behave.  With the Norelco, I knew that each pass would cause me more pain in the future.  The shave seems comparable from each razor, both do a good job, but the Braun wins hands down on how it treats my face.  The battery life on the Braun seems great, and it has an indicator when it's getting low.  It's also got a nice feel to it.	2002-01-20

It took a few times using it to get used to the vibrations and the variable settings were helpful when getting started.  By the third day or so I was already able to use the highest setting.  It does only come with one brush head, but I found plenty heads in stock at the local department store (Hechts) and was able to purchase two extras there.  I would highly reccommend this to anyone still on the fence about sonic toothbrushes.  I love how clean my mouth feels after using it.  Definately worth the money.	2002-01-20

This scale appealed to me because it has an &quot;athlete&quot; mode for exceptionally lean people.  Also, the reviews on the other Tanita scales (on Amazon and elsewhere on the web) seemed generally better than those for other brands.<br />This scale reads weight to the nearest 0.2 pounds and body fat to the nearest 0.1%.  The scale seems very accurate with weight.  Unlike my old scale, I get very repeatable results with this one and it correlates well with the expensive beam type scale at my health club (also unlike my old one).<br />The body fat feature also works better than I expected.  My body fat reads about 12% - 13% in the normal &quot;adult&quot; mode and about 8.5% in the &quot;athlete&quot; mode.  The caliper method yields around 10% - 11% so I'm happy with the scale's reading (I'm don't qualify as an &quot;athlete&quot; by Tanita's standards--at least yet).<br />As you'll read in the manual (and elsewhere) hydration affects the accuracy of electrical body fat measurements.  For that reason, you get the highest readings first thing in the morning when you're dehydrated from sleep.  For me, it might be 13.5%.  You get the lowest readings mid-day when you're well hydrated (for me about 12.0%).  Women (or possibly men with much higher body fat?) seem to show a wider fluctuation.<br />I thought things like having wet feet right out of the shower or a full/empty bladder would affect the accuracy but they don't seem to.  Short of drinking a bunch of water for a few hours before (or dehydrating yourself) there's not much you can do to change the body fat readings.<br />If you use the scale at roughly the same time each day, it's fairly consistent and indeed has been showing my progress with diet and exercise nicely.<br />There are two buttons on the front edge and you kick one or the other with your toe to turn the scale on and tell it which of two users you are.  You have to program in your height, sex, etc. just once.  It's easy to set up.  <br />Once you kick the button, it takes 3 seconds or so to &quot;zero&quot; and then you step on.  Your weight shows up nearly instantly and then the body fat measurement takes another few seconds.  When it has both readings, it alternates back and forth showing them both on the display until it automatically shuts off.<br />I don't know how long it will last, but for now I'm quite happy with mine.	2002-01-19

The quality of this razor is very good, but it has one MAJOR drawback and one minor one. Everyone talks about the cleaning stand which I also agree is very neat and does a good job of cleaning the razor, but the problem is neck hair. If you look at any of the consumer bulletin boards, you'll see the same complaint over and over. This thing simply doesn't trim long hair that runs flat at the neck line (or for that matter any long hairs). You must use the beard trimmer to get these and that really doesn't work well either. The other minor complaint is that this that this thing is VERY loud. Shaving around the sideburn area close to your ear is just uncomfortable because the razor is so loud (not to mention waking up your wife early in the morning). Finally (a minor minor thing) is that the cleaner cycle throws a mist or smell in the air of cleaner fluid (alcohol like) that I don't really like the smell of. Some many like it so this is no real big deal, but it is there.	2002-01-13

They say this razor will shave as close as a blade.  Well, I'm here to tell you that they're right.<br />I've been shaving with cordless razors for as long as I can remember.  I've gone through Braun, Norelco, and Remington razors over the last 20 years or so and haven't been very satisfied with any of them.  Then I got this razor.  Man, what a difference!<br />This is the first razor that actually does what it claims.  It shaves VERY close.  True, I still get a 5:00 shadow, but I get that with a straight razor as well.  <br />The other thing about this shaver is that it's so quiet.  You can actually tell when you are cutting hair as opposed to just moving around.  The heads truly float.  Some razors claim floating heads, but it's not very accurate.  This razor has true floating/pivoting heads.  You hardly have to do anything to get into all the grooves and contours.<br />The ability to clean the razor under the tap was the biggest reason I took a chance on this one.  It states that there is a cleaning indicator on it.  Don't let this mis-lead you.  Technically that cleaning alert is no more than a calendar based alarm that will just go off about once a week if the top is not opened.  Outside of that, cleaning it is a snap.  Just pop the top and run water over it and you have a clean fresh razor!<br />I highly reccomend this razor to anyone and everyone.	2002-01-11

However, there is some truth to the fact that it is a little harder to use than a rotary. The reason is simply that the Braun MUST be used against the grain of your hair (the direction of which changes all over your face) whereas a rotary is perfecty symetric and it doesn't matter. When used correctly, which means learning your particular face patterns, there is little argument that the Braun will shave closer than any rotary, as a foil can be made much thinner than a rotary &quot;cage.&quot; In fact, the very closeness of the shave is why some people are complaining about ingrown hairs. There shaver does have definite difficulty with long, flat-lying hairs, perhaps even more so than other electrics, which is its only significant problem in my opinion. The cleaning system is actually incredibly effective, and leaves the razor perfectly clean and lubricated. The complaints about dirty alcohol are not warranted, as alcohol is a disinfectant and all solid materials settle into traps at the bottom of the container (and aren't pulled into the stream of reciprocating alcohol). Quite clever! The only other negative is that the ergonomics of the device could be much better, especially relative to Norelco products. All in all, I'm very happy with my unit; regardless of some of the negatives I can get an excellent shave in the quickest amount of time of any of the alternatives I've ever tried (which includes blades).	2002-01-09

And this shaver DOES shave like a razor without the nicks.<br />Points that I love about this shaver:<br />* Quiet<br />* Very close shave<br />* Easily and dummy proof, since it reminds you, cleaning with plain running hot water<br />* Good ergonomics<br />* Lit LCD Display with info on status of charge and cleaning time<br />* Semi-soft plastic stand, not the rigid plastics, just in case you knock it off the counter it won't crack.<br />* Carry case<br />Points I didn't like:<br />* Can't charge the shaver in the stand since the AC plug goes under the shaver.<br />* Norelco's are probably the most expensive shavers on the market so you are really paying for the carry case<br />* That's about all the bad points.	2002-01-08

I have to agree that this is an excellent shaver, and for most of my face it shaves amazingly close and smooth. I just got the 6520 (reconditioned) and I cannot get over how smooth the skin is under the nose and above the lip after a shave. I never got this close even with a blade.  However, I must also agree with the fellas that complain about the neck hair problem.  Try as I might, I can't get this or any foil razor to really tackle that problem ... and indeed I do risk razor burn in attempting to get a clean shave in this difficult area.  As to the suggestion of getting a rotary razor, I say forget that!  I bought one once while on vacation (having forgotten to pack my Braun). What a waste of money!  Felt like I was using a dull rotary sander.  Now, to the guy whose 6520 discharged during his trip .. I think that he has no one to blame but himself.  This shaver is equipped with a lock feature that is designed to prevent this from happening.  A great idea on Braun's part and it works.  This is my 3rd Braun in well over 18 years. All are still running, though the battery is shot on the first. The second razor, at least ten years old, works fine.  I just figured that technology must have improved over time and thought I would check out the Ultra Speeds from Braun. Glad I did .. love this razor!  Braun shavers are very well made and I would expect my new 6520 to put in a good five plus years of service at minimum, and I would not be surprised to get ten.  Highly recommended.  - Update, 15 years later  (2017)  This baby is still running strong, and notably, it shaves better than the new Braun model 8585 Activator.	2002-01-02

I've been using the Ultrasonex in conjunction with an oral irrigator for over a year and am very happy with the results. On my last dental check-up and cleaning, the hygenist inquired as to what I'd been doing differently as my gums were in such good shape. The difference was the toothbrush. The three minute timer is a great feature and keeps me &quot;honest&quot;. Another good feature is the comparatively low price of replacement heads. I would have given the product 5 stars if I was able to buy replacement brushes locally. There is no store in my local area which carries them, so I have to plan ahead a bit, but the toothbrush is worth the small extra effort.	2001-12-30

I was excited by the self cleaning feature .. until I realized I was cleaning my shaver with VERY dirty alcohol after the first few cleanings. Although the cleaning might seem convenient, I found it to be more annoying than useful and went back to the brush &amp; wastebasket method.  And, the shaver and cleaner were much noisier than I would like.  I had previously owned Norelco shavers that never shaved close .. but were gentle on my very sensitive throat area.  The Braun shavers DO shave closer but aren't quite as gentle as I require and I still come away with nicks on a fairly regular basis.  I am about to try the latest Norelco Quadro and will report on that after I've tried it.	2001-12-29

It can be painful if rubbed over bony areas such as directly over the spine or tip of the shoulder area.  However, when kept of the &quot;meaty&quot; tissue, it does a good job of massaging and it is a much deeper massage than with an other home unit that I have tried.  It has 4 different tips that are easy to change on the head of the massager.  Heat is also included on this unit and comes with specific tips for the heat mode.  There is a soft, medium and aggressive tip also included.  Don't get me wrong, nothing will replace human hands when it comes to having a massage, but this is a nice thing to have when you want your back rubbed and there is no one to do it.  It also works if you have that significant other that is just too tired to massage you but is willing to rub this up and down on your back, or your legs, or wherever!	2001-12-26

Was interested in PL4 (twice the price of Homedics' but does come with 3 brushes) but according to literature PL4 should be considered to be a personal brush since it increases in speed during the first twelve uses until it reaches full speed and stays that way (a stupid idea in my opinion). The HoMedics HD-500 Sonic Wave Toothbrush, however, has 7 selectable speeds. I originally hoped that it would be a 7 position slide switch and I was initially disappointed to see it has a stepthrough pushbutton, but it really isn't so bad after all. I have only had it 2 days so I am still tender. I start with step 2 for the roof of my mouth, then step 3 for inside of uppers, switch to step 5 for inside of lowers and although I have had it only two days I can already take speed 7 on outsides of the teeth and gums.<br />It can vibrate very fast but, unless I am missing something, \\"SONIC\\" it is not (it seems to be just hype, a buzzing sound of the motor and a name) but that is ok with me because it is doing for me what I have not been doing for myself.<BR>When I was 40 I was told that unless I got into the habit of brushing and flossing properly I would loose my teeth by age 50. I didn't and have dodged the bullet until age 59 but I could now see I MUST do something or loose them for real.

The other reviewers have done a good job describing it so I'll try to mention the features not covered already.<br />The LCD control is clear and easy to use.  It displays all 10 vibrating nodes and what they are doing depending on what massage mode you are in.  You have the option of turning off one or more of the massage areas (5 sets of 2 nodes) so you can focus on particular parts of your back or legs if you want to.  With the nine massage patterns, three intensities, and three speeds, this massager has just about every option you could want.  <br />There is an automatic shutoff timer (which defaults to 10 minutes) that you can set in 10 minute increments up to one hour. <br />The massager has straps on the back for holding it onto a chair or car seat.<br />I have three, mostly minor, complaints with this massager.  1)  The heat seems to be concentrated in the middle back area rather than all over the seat and back.  2)  The material, though smooth and nice looking, smells kind of strange (like rubber or tar maybe?).  Not that you are going to have your face on it, but I did notice that my hand smelled after touching the material, and that my shirt smelled after sitting on the massager for a while.  3)  The power plug has a large transformer brick on it, which can make it difficult to plug into an outlet (I should point out that a cigarette lighter adapter for a car is also included).<br />Overall, this massager works well, is a good deal for the price, and I recommend it.	2001-12-16

First, a little background. Most recently I used the Gillette Mach 3 razor which does a very good job.

This is the first electric razor I've used that shaves as close as a blade (including the Mach 3). <br />- Great for guy with sensitive skin<br />- It's quiet!!!<br />- Easy to clean.

Nevertheless, it provides the best shave ever. It's got all the bells and whistles a guy would want. If the price is a little too high, you might want to try the quadra action model without the lcd, it is much cheaper.

I bought this razor based on the rave reviews it received here.  Well, I guess you can say I'm half impressed with it since it does a good job on half of the shave.  For the upper part of may face it does a great job, better than my Norelco 5825 XL.  It shaves much easier, quicker, and closer.  However, for the lower part, under my chin and the neck area I find it very difficult to shave.  I would actually use my Norelco for the lower part and the Braun for the upper part.  Either I'm not skilled enough with this type of razor technology or its just not very easy to use on the lower part of the shave.  I suspect its the former, but maybe others have this problem too.<br />Another note, the display began showing &quot;garbage&quot; and has never returned to normal.  This was after only a few uses.<br />Other features such as the display (when it worked) and the self cleaning were great and I wish my Norelco had them.

As someone pointed out, the fat % can vary wildly.  I am pretty sure that it's actually measuring water content (read that somewhere in the manual I think), and so if you don't have a stable body-water content, then the percentages will be wildly variable.  Most people are dehydrated, I've found, so the numbers are wrong.  Once I got back to drinking the amount of water I needed (prob 64oz/day), I've found the numbers to be not only stable, but also close to what a professional measurement will get you.	2001-11-28

It works as advertised: cuts hair quickly and cleanly without pain or discomfort.  Easy to clean and store.  The switch is responsive and easy to use, with a very tactile &quot;slide&quot; that makes it easy to firmly place in either the &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; position.<br />The only demerit I can think of is that, when gripped firmly, you can feel a slight &quot;creaking&quot; to the plastic housing.  No specific reason to think that it is a defect in this sort of small and inexpensive appliance, but I am accustomed to considering that a demerit in higher-priced electronic gadgets (cell phones, PDAs, pagers), so perhaps it bears brief mention here.<br />I will also point out that unless I am very much mistaken, this trimmer has been selected by several well-known retailers of gadgets as their &quot;best of category&quot; item.  Hence, I apparently am not the only one who has had a good experience with this trimmer.	2001-11-27

I do not know how well anyone else gets along with shaving, but I've always had a bad time. I thought &quot;Mach 3&quot; was the best razor one could buy. But even that could not stop my chin from getting literally chewed up. After I was done shaving, it looked like I just got done rubbing sandpaper over my chin and upper lip area. Based on some of the other reviews, I bought the Quadra and have been happy ever since.<BR> Personally I've found out 2 things(just from my perspective):<BR>1) The 2-3 week period for letting your skin getting used to the razor is TRUE. But I found just after week or so, it took me just 3-4 minutes to shave and NO burning, itching or anything.<BR>2) As said by some others, so easy to clean you don't think it's enough. But as I found by not letting my whiskers growing too long, this beast chopped up the &quot;shaved&quot; whiskers and are almost powdery when I clean the razor.	2001-11-23

Since I have been using Norelcos, my face no longer looks as if has been tenderized on regular basis. About the only gripe I have with Norelco is the relatively high cost of the replacement heads (approx $25). Since I bought my latest 5841 about 1 year ago it is safe to assume that I like this product.	2001-11-19

Brauns flat-head electric ravors have always been pretty much fine for me, but I was willing to try this one to try and reduce the hassle/occassional discomfort.  Admittedly, it seems solidly constructed, has a powerful motor and &quot;feels&quot; like a quality product.  It shaves fairly close, and perhaps misses fewer stray hairs then the flat-head electric razors.  It also does fairly well on the typical weekend growth.  However, on an overal closeness basis it doesn't seem superior to the better Brauns I have used.  (Braun does make some low-end shavers to avoid).  The 6885 does have some downsides - it seems to take longer to use then the better Brauns, and is certainly rougher on the face.  They say it takes 20 days to get used to it; I've had it for around 40, and its still rougher on the face then my old Braun. Nothing serious, but I have redness for a few minutes after each shave.  My bottom line is that this is a quality razor that might rate a &quot;4&quot; if it were more reasonably priced.  As it is, I would go with a nice 80 or 90 dollar Braun if I had it to do over.	2001-11-13

The shaver also malfunctions sometimes when turning on and I'll need to give it a whack on the face to power it up. I've been through three foil shavers, a Braun, Remington and this Panasonic. All of them wore out, but of the three the Braun lasted the longest so I think I'll go with another new model Braun...	2001-11-12

The manual however is a textbook example of how NOT to produce product documentation.  It is confusing, poorly organized, suffers from an over-abundance of font styles and sizes (most too small, despite large page sizes) and does not do what a manual should: show a new user how to use the product quickly and reliably.<br />The manual has one section labeled &quot;Intro and Setup&quot; a second entitled &quot;Using the Monitor for the first time&quot; and a third entitled &quot;Taking Readings.&quot;  These are all proceeded by a page which says &quot;Before using your monitor for the first time...&quot;  <br />What is needed is a simple, &quot;quick start&quot; step-by-step guide to using the monitor.  Do I setup my SmartCard first? Do I enter my codes first? Do I activate the monitor by phone first?  I'm still not sure.<br />If this wasn't bad enough there is another legal-sized, quad-folded instruction sheet, printed on both sides that comes with the test strips--it has a better set of instructions, but ones which are difficult to correlate with the larger manual.<br />Give yourself some time to decode the manual before using and be prepared to refressh yourself with the instructions in the test strip kit when using it, but once you are familiar with it, the Lifestream Monitor is a good home test unit.  It would be less daunting to the uninitiated if the manuals had to pass a strict &quot;new-user&quot; test and be made simpler and more clear.<br />Personally, I have managed to lower my cholesterol by 49 points since getting it and starting an exercise program.	2001-11-11

I have been a user of these electric shavers for several years since the original brand was Phillishave from Phillips. Now that the battery of my old model was running out, I had to replace it with a new one. It looks like Norelco took the market that Phillips was managing and unfortunately I don't see ANY real competition for the &quot;3 head design&quot;. This is the only reason that explaines the EXORBITANT price in the market (my perception). But after looking for a while, I found a similar model in a NY pharmacy made in China with a reasonable price of $20. It works pretty fine and I'm happy with it. Assuming that the manufacturing cost in China is only 80% of the retail price, I believe that Norelco could be obtaining a profitability margin that goes close from 200 to 500% compared to the 5 to 10% of the Chinese product. I wish I had a business like this one!!	2001-11-07

I have a very sensitive skin, and my facial hair has the nasty tendency to cling very closely to my face therefore it is really hard to cut it with an electric razor. For me in order to get a perfect shave I had to use a blade against the direction of the growth of the hair. The problem was that next day my face blow off so there was no way for me to do this for 2 days not talking about a week. So I shaved only one direction, which resulted in a very poor job, by 3 PM I looked like a drunken.<br />I had a Braun a few years ago and my skin was irritated by it and it broke down after 2 years so I figured I will try Phillips (Norelco here) this time.<br />I have it for 3 weeks and use it daily. After the first 2-3 uses my face got red and ugly again, but I did not give up and I guess I got used to it because I am just fine. I use it every day once, and I only get a little redness on my neck area where I have a harder time to get the hair. But by the time I leave the house the redness is gone. After some practice I am able to get the hair 99% perfectly, I really have to look to find those single ones hiding here and there and since I am using it regularly there is less and less hair that gets away. My face is very smooth.<br />I like the design of this product very much. The charger indicator is a useful feature and it really indicates the actual amount of time remaining unlike most indicators. The easy cleaning and the nice 3 years warranty, plus the money back guarantee makes it worth the extra 40-50 over the Braun and you can't loose anything just send it back iff you don't like it.<br />The only thing I didn't like was the non-hard holder that came with it through amazon's offer. I though they have the hard cover.	2001-11-02

After reading the reviews at Amazon.com and at a site that reviews electric razors, I choose the Braun 6520.  It was rated high and its price was half of the leading razor.  I also crossed check the price against other retailers and Amazon.com was [less expensive] and shipped one day sooner.  <br />I have a tough beard that grows fast coupled with a tender face.  My Remington 300 was the first razor to allow me to use an electric shaver and make it through the day without looking like a beatnik; however, after 5 years the screens are impossible to find so it was time for a new shaver.  The new Braun came as advertised and was charged up the very first time in only 4 hours versus 14 for my old 300.   The charged and low charge lights are handy and the ability to charge a dead razor for a shave in 3 minutes is a great advantage.  I have found in the past that a preshave liquid improves the closeness of the shave and that has been true with the Braun as well.  By the third day my face had adjusted to the shaver and I am getting the closest shave ever with no skin irritation.   The shaver also does a great job with neck hairs and the occasional long hair.    One significant reason that I selected this razor was the changing of the screen and cutters at 18 months.   My old 300 required a screen or screen/cutter replacement every 6 months so this saves $30 over that 18 month period.   When selecting a razor be sure to pay attention to this or any \\"self-cleaning\\" liquids that you have to purchase on a regular basis.   The 6520 uses a floating head but is switchable to lock the head for hard areas like under the nose.  I found that I still get the best shave by moving my hand against the grain of the hair before I run the shaver there and you will want to shave against the grain too.  This was required with my old 300 and is indicative of most foil razors.   This is not required of rotary shavers but most research that I read indicates that a foil provides a closer shave.<br />I am very happy with this razor.   It works great!	2001-10-23

The bells and whistles are convenient, they let you see how much shaving time you have left and when to clean it. Using water to clean it is a time saver. The &quot;stand&quot; they give you with it is a joke. It doesn't fit the razor, I discarded it and used my old stand. The razor is also very quiet compared to the razor I had.

It shaves quicker and closer and has a better trimmer.  (I am comparing a new Braun with a new Norelco.)  It also has far fewer parts to clean than the rotary head Norelco.  Cleaning the Norelco WAS A CHORE!  The battery capacity is about the same in terms of number of shaves per charge.  I suspect the battery lifetime will also be about the same, e.g., 4-6 years.  The Braun is lighter and feels better in the hand.  The norelco has a better traveling case though- it fits into my toilet travel case easier.  The ultra high speed feature of the Braun is a must.  If you want to shave quicker one tends to move the shaver rapidly across the beard area usually resulting in a poor shave with the Norelco thus requiring another pass which takes more time. Not so with the ultra speed Braun.  I would recommend the ultra speed Braun models (6000 or above) to anyone.	2001-10-20

My Cholesterol was under control due to medication but I was growing more and more concerned about the long term effects that the medication might have and was strongly wanting to slowly &quot;wean&quot; myself off the medication in favor of a more controlled diet. To do this meant more frequent checks of my Cholesterol Levels and I didn't really want it to mean more frequent DOCTOR visits.<br />So I purchased the Lifestream Monitor and it is everything I could have asked for in a home monitor. The instructions are simple and easy to read. It comes with a video that helps you visualize the process and the the process really is easy. Also, there is no fasting required so you don't have to skip eating.<br />The whole test takes less than 5 minutes and costs a lot less (per test) than a doctors visit. Also, results are stored on a Personal Health Card(one included)which holds up to 200 test results and can be taken with you when you go back to your doctor. The card also stores other important medical data and could be invaluable to medical personel in an emergency.<br />Lifestream has to be called, or contacted at their web address in order to activate your Monitor before use. This was confusing at first but, I believe this is good because it puts you in contact with a person who will answer any concerns and actually talk you through your first test if neccessary.<br /> It was a slight disapointment to find that there were NO test strips included with the Monitor but, these strips have expiration dates so it would be difficult to keep &quot;fresh&quot; strips in the monitors setting on the store shelves. Lifestream will send you two strips after you call them and activate your monitor but, if you want to perform your first test the day you purchase your monitor you will need to purchase a package (6 strips) along with your monitor.<br />Overall, I am very happy with my monitor and it would benefit even those without current cholesterol concerns. It never hurts to know what your cholesterol level is RIGHT NOW. And with this monitor you can know your level as often as you want.or and it would benefit even those without current cholesterol concerns.

Shaver works well and charges fast.  I am a little disappointed in the closeness of the shave and that it is not adjustable.  Cleaninf is very convenient.  Just open it up and rinse the blades and foil under running water.  But beware.  You have to leave the head open for drying.  The 2nd time I used it the head had an odor like stinky feet.

Easy to read &amp; use.<BR>Cons: Doctor's office styling. Can't weigh small amounts.<BR>I like this scale, but my wife was dismayed by the large size and the styling (see the picture). It takes up a fair amount of floor space and screams, &quot;I'm serious about my weight&quot; -- a message you might not want to make public. But it's easy to use. There are no adjustments. You put it on a hard, flat surface, step on it, watch it &quot;think&quot; about your weight for 2-10 seconds, during which zeros flash on the screen. It then displays your weight in very large numerals to the nearest 0.5 lbs. It seems to self-zero after each use, which should keep the reading accurate indefinitely. You need to stand still until the reading appears, however. The more you move, the longer it takes (or you get an error message).<BR>I tested it in several ways. First, I stood two 45.0 pound olympic weights on edge in the two footprint locations. It quickly stabilized at 90.0 lbs each of the 6 times I did so.<BR>Next I ran 30 trials in which I either weighed myself, or had weights of 5 or 15 lbs. clutched to my chest (done in random order, with about 30 seconds between trials). The results (mean, range, standard deviation in pounds):<BR>me: 177.2, 176.5 to 178.0, 0.4<BR>me+5: 182.9, 182.0 to 184.5, 0.7<BR>me+15: 191.5, 191.0 to 192.0, 0.5<BR>These are less impressive (and probably more realistic), but not bad.<BR>I noticed that it wouldn't turn on for a single 45 lb weight. The manual says it can go down to 40 lb, but that didn't seem to be the case with mine. (I didn't try to find the lower limit.) This might be an issue if you're using it with children, who might also have trouble keeping still for long enough to obtain a reading.	2001-09-13

So here's the deal: I owned a Panasonic ER389K for about two years and it worked great. Then the battery died and it is not replacable. I thought, \\"Forget this, I'm getting a dual mode trimmer.\\" I ordered the Remington MB40. Well actually two. One of the pins that holds on the depth gauge broke off even before I got to use the first one. It turns out that if the depth is set to \\"0\\" then there is at least a reduced possibility of breaking these pins. Then I got the second one, gingerly handled the depth gauge as if it might break, charged it up and began trimming. I was immediately impressed with the power. I was not impressed with how close of a trim I could get. But I discovered that if I used the mustache trimmer (about 1/2\\" wide) I could get as close a trim as I got with the Panasonic. Very tedious. After a couple of weeks of this I ordered a new Panasonic. It's less expensive, the depth gauge will not break, I can get a much closer trim, the charger is built in, it's smaller, it's much simpler to use, and loads quieter. THAT'S 7 THINGS BETTER! I decided that I could do without the corded feature - I don't like cords anyway.  I don't believe that there are any trimmers that are water proof - that would be a useful feature for cleaning.	2001-09-09

NOTHING shaves as quickly or as closely as a blade. Given that starting point, however, this little beauty is probably as good as an electric gets. I have used Norelco and Braun shavers for years (with a slight detour for a Panasonic). This model Norelco gives the closest electric shave my heavy daily growth has experienced, with absolutely no razor burn nor the necessity of a &quot;touch up&quot; with a blade. It is quiet and clean-up with running water is a cinch. It takes longer than some to fully recharge, but unless you plan to stand over it for an hour, this is hardly an inconvenience. The model can be bought with an adapter for the car (which came with mine). Shaving while driving, however, may be a manifestation of a death wish and probably falls in the same category as using the cell phone while on the highway. In sum, I couldn't be happier with this gem. Norelco has hit a home run.	2001-08-29

Real men visiting the site are asked to review their razors whatever the brand, and this Panasonic Linear shaver comes out on top. The top Norelco triple blade came in a close second. So I bought one. I consider myself a real man and take it from me this is a pretty good shaver. Before I got this shaver I would shave dry in my car with a bic single blade disposable on my way to work. Now that I have a Panasonic Linear shaver, I am much more civilized and shave over my sink. The razor is pretty nice in that it does not drop a whole lot razor nubs into the sink. Most fall into the little compartment that holds the blade. Its a friggen disgusting mess of oily little hair shavings when you finally clean it, but it rinses out really quickly and that makes it not so bad. I tried using it in the shower for a while. You seem to get a slightly closer shave in the shower but its top heavy and kept falling off my soap rack and dropping four and a half feet onto the porcelain. It doesn't look damaged at all so its pretty tough little unit. I decided for the life of my tub and the razor I would shave at the sink. You get thirteen shaves on a single charge which is pretty darned good. I have never picked it up and found the battery dead. I suspect most men hold the razor in one hand like a half a ham sandwich. This works pretty good, but for a really close shave drop it in your palm, close your hand around it like the grip of big 44 magnum revolver and press it into your face. Now your ready to remove the toughest beard. The razor also has a sideburn and moustache trimmer on the side. No electric razor is perfect and there are times when it is useful to keep regular blade on hand to pick up stragglers but all in all the Panasonic linear lives up to expectations.	2001-08-28

I cannot get a satisfactory shaving quality even with 25 minutes of shaving. Once a week I have to use a regular razor to clean up the hair that this electric razor failed to remove. My face and neck now stay irritated all the time. The remaining shave time indicator is very handy, but since the utmost requirement to a razor is the shaving quality, I wouldn't recommend it at this price. Despite the fact that I followed the charging instructions, after 2-3 months of usage, I can get 37-38 minutes at most. I was traveling with it in Europe (the electrical current in the countries I visited was ~220V/50Hz). Even though it is designed to be dual voltage, I never got over 34 minutes of shaving time.	2001-08-16

I had grown used to the comfort of a wet shave but had sworn off Norelco shavers due to their relatively high cost until I found this one. At $64.99, this Norelco has to be the best deal going. It dispenses self-contained Nivea lotion that results in a smooth, close and burn-free shave. Cleaning is a snap..just rinse under hot running water. There is a &quot;deluxe&quot; model available (#5655X) but I doubt the additional $80 is going to result in a better shave. This is a great combination...traditional Norelco quality, the comfort of a wet shave and a super price. It includes an electronic on/off switch, charge indicator light, counter top charging stand, travel case and a supply of Nivea shaving lotion cartridges. Unbeatable combination!	2001-08-14

This shaver provides a quick and reliable shave that I require. If I had to go back to another razor I would be devastated.<br />Here are the main reasons I like this shaver:<br />(1) Shaves great with NO trouble spots. After a life time of buying various electric razors, this is the FIRST one that absolutely gave me the total shaving solution.<br />(2) Blades are designed to be replaced every SIX months<br />(3) Unit cleans in tap water from your bathroom sink<br />(4) PERFECT included travel case - hard plastic with room for the shaver and the rechargable cord<br />(5) Fast charging times<br />(6) Power drop off (cordless) is quick and sudden, which is good. There is nothing worse than a shaver that spins at slower speeds the closer it is to a re-charge<br />(7) Nice visual indication of charging status and available power. It lets you know when it is time to re-charge before you get the power drop.<br />(8) It features a pop out trimmer that works great and is able to take care of my needs - I no longer need any other equipment.<br />The only negative comments I have are concerning the price. Even the replacement blades are a little expensive... But, for all of the performance that it delivers I can say that it is worth the price.	2001-08-04

I really like the feeling my mouth has after I use this electric toothbrush. Everytime I brush, it feels like a trip to the dentist! The toothbrush automatically shuts off in 2 minutes, so you don't overbrush, and there is no battery requirement.  Simply plug it in the base and put the toothbrush back on the charger when you are finshed.  Another plus is the affortability, and replacement heads run around 12-15$ a couple times a year.

I was thrilled when I got my Norelco 6885XL about a month back. I read the users manual and noticed the fact that it takes at least 21 days to get used to the shaver. Although my facial hair grows very fast, I usually tend to shave once in a couple of days. Considering this, I felt I should give myself atleast 40 days to get used to the shaver. I have to tell you that I was not disappointed save for nitpicky problems! The shaver has some excellent features and a couple of could-be-better aspects. I have listed the pros and cons below.<br />Pros:<br />1. Great design - Fits perfectly in your hand.<br />2. LOVE the LCD - The display is great with a lot of features (backlit with minutes remaining, cleaning reminder, charge reminder etc).<br />3. Effective blades - The three rotating, swiveling heads are very efficient, the Quadra Action works well and the motors are extremely quiet.<br />4. Built-in trimmer - Works well with sideburns.<br />5. Cleaning - You will drop down on your knees and thank Norelco for making the shaver so easy to clean! Just hold the shaver under warm/hot water and it cleans in a jiffy! No brushes (although it is included), no blowing and getting hair in your eyes, no fear of using a shaver with a wet face, and so on. This is one of the best features, in my opinion.<br />6. Incredible warranty - Norelco fixes or replaces anything and everything for for two years! The warranty is so good that they replace the charger cord, brush and the protective cap even if you lose them, all for just shipping charges.<br />7. Nice stand to place the shaver when not in use.<br />Cons:<br />1. It takes a LONG time for the regions of the neck and chin to get used to the shaver. I am not entirely satisfied with the shave because of this, but I hope it gets better with time.<br />2. The 6885XL does not come with the car adapter, which is sold separately, while the 6886XL (sold at warehouse stores like Costco and Sam's Club) includes the car adapter for the same price.<br />3. The minutes remaning on the LCD is deceptive in the beginning as it does not display the right amount of time left. This fact was in the manual but I overlooked it. It takes about 4-5 charges for it to display the accurate time remaining for some reason. The good part is that no matter what, the shaver gets to a full 45 minute charge in barely an hour!<br />4. While the carry case is bulky, it is very effective in the fact that it protects the shaver well, and is cleverly designed to hold the shaver, the charger (without the big plug getting in the way) and brush.<br />Before I bought the shaver, I had shortlisted my choice down to two. The 6885XL and the Braun Syncro (with LCD). While both are considered equally good, people tend to overlook one main problem with the Syncro. The self-cleaning cartridges. While they are readily available now, each of them costs around $10 and last for a month with average shaving. This means you have to invest $10 a month to keep the shaver clean or risk getting the blades dull. The Norelco has easy cleaning, and no added charges after the purchase except for new blades every year.<br />Finally, I gave it 4 stars only because of my problem with the effectiveness of the shaver in the neck regions. I am hoping that gets better soon and I don't have to use a regular razor to shave for the finishing touches. I strongly recommend the Norelco 6885XL (better yet, 6886XL). You won't be disappointed. My mornings are much less of a chore now! :-)ce.<br />3. The minutes remaning on the LCD is deceptive in the beginning as it does not display the right amount of time left.

I also have sensitive teeth and worry about the health of my gums and because the Sonic Wave has various settings to allow for the perfect touch it sparked my interest.  The best part is that it has a timer and shuts off automatically when I have brushed for two full minutes.

So, for a newborn, this is an easy, accurate and INEXPENSIVE alternative.<br />The tradeoff is that this thermometer is much slower to provide the final temperature.  As those with a squirming newborn and infant know, time is essential.<br />Ahh, but isn't life a series of tradeoffs . . .  Speed versus accuracy, speed versus expense.  The Thermoscan versus underarm thermometer is just another of those tradeoffs.<br />That said, buy both.  For a newborn, the underarm is more accurate, albeit slower.  For a older infant, the Thermoscan is faster and accurate.	2001-07-11

After using this for about a week now, I feel that it was a good investment.  It gives a nice clean, smooth shave. (better than my old Norelco). The shave really is as good as with a blade (minus the nicks and cuts)  I was amazed at how light it is &#8211; probably weighs half of what my old Norelco weighed.  The heads adjust to your face much better.  I also like the fact that the batteries can be replaced much easier. On previous models, the batteries were soldered in and they were a pain to replace.<br />One negative comment: The case on this is huge.  It probably takes up 3 times as much space as my old Norelco did.  Most of the extra space is taken up by the cord that has electronics built into it to adapt between 110 and 220 volts.<br />If you&#8217;re looking for a great razor, and don&#8217;t mind spending this much to get it, then you&#8217;ll love this one.<br />Why only 4 stars?

The second one worked fine and lasted 3 months.  The third one doesn't always spin properly when brushing.  I have to hold it away from my teeth to get it back on track.

Whenever I use it in front of the TV, I always have to crank up the volume extremely high to hear the TV.  Second, its heating capacity.  The instructions say quite clearly that it cannot heat up water, merely maintain the heat level of the water you place in it.  However, it doesn't do as good a job of that as it ought to.  After 15 minutes, I found the water lukewarm no matter how much steaming hot water was placed in it at the beginning.  If I want to continue, I have to dump the lukewarm water out and fill it up again.  Still, sometimes all a person wants is 15 minutes of pedi cure bliss, so that's not a point to worry about if that person is you.<br />On the good side, I loved the texture of the bottom.  It had nubs in varying sizes all over, and unlike some footbaths, the water extends all around the product (under the blue shield on top) so that the water path forms a &quot;U&quot;.  This allows for a lot more movement for your feet.<br />The removable rollers are very intense, and when you insert them into the bottom of the product, your feet cannot fit fully into the water, so I find it best to do your soaking without them present and to use the spiky rollers for before or after.<br />The little station above the infrared (red spot) was a delight.  It goes into action whenever pressure is applied and the unit is plugged in, so you can use it completely independently of the footbath.  My favorite is the one with six little balls that rotate against my tired feet.  The pumice stone attachment is also worthwhile, but the brush attachment didn't do anything for me.  I think it's probably more useful if you just take it into your hand and use it as a normal foot brush.<br />I have to say this is the best footbath I've ever owned, and there are some points the company needs to work on, but overall, this is a great product that delivers.work on, but overall, this is a great product that delivers.	2001-07-02

About a year back, I took my first plunge into electric shavers and went with the Norelco three head roatary blades. Worked kind of okay and did the job, but the shave was never that close. <br />When it was time to replace it, I tried the Braun. Though I was very apprehensive of the foil system, all my fears were misplaced. This gives a fast and close shave that the rotary system cannot match. First three shaves are done and still no sign of any irritation at all. With any electric shaver, the first few shaves are a big mess on your face; not so with the Braun. Ni-MH batteries are a big plus as I do not have to worry about the memory effect. Neat and sylish looks are extra brownie points.<br />If there is one thing I do not like, it is the vibration and noise. Its kind of irritating after you use the Norelco's which neither vibrate not make a irritating noise.<br />All said and done, Im one happy customer. I cannot review the cleaning system because I have the 7505 base model that does not have the cleaning system (Though is compatible). $... is a lot of money for me to spend on a cleaning system and the recurring cost of the catriges is a big NO-NO as far as Im concerned.	2001-06-27

I bought this razor a month ago, because I thought I could save time with a fast, electric shave. It has always been a pain for me to wake up every morning a couple of minutes earlier just so that I could soak my face in hot water to get a closer shave. After arriving to work late a couple of times, due to the long process of soaking/shaving in the morning, I thought it was time for an electric. I used my friend's Braun razor on which he spent 50 bucks, but I found the closeness of Braun to be around 80 percent to that of a blade. So I was thinking by spending 150 bucks on Norelco's top-of-the-line razor, that I would have a nice quick &amp; easy shave in the morning comparable to my blade. Boy was I wrong! <br />Norelco states in their manuals that you should use their shavers for 21 days straight. After a week, I noticed that the skin around my neck started to turn red. My friends would laugh at me because I literally had a &quot;red-neck&quot;. Then I would use after-shave thinking that would work. But by the second week, my skin was so irritated that it broke out into a rash. I didn't even make the 21 days. I thought to myself, &quot;was worth it to spend 150 bucks so that my neck could break out into a rash?&quot; Obviously it wasn't. <br />I returned the razor the next day and went back to my blades. Hopefully you'll have better luck than me with this razor, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know.	2001-06-26

I've been using Norelco razors for over 30 years. This is my fourth razor. This should tell you two things. One, I'm old and two, these razors last. This razor is the best ever. In addition to the individual head movement, all three heads move simultaneously to better conform to your face. The shave is clearly, smoother, closer and more comfortable than ever. The LED is a nice added touch. It indicates how much shaving time is left to the charge so you're not surprised mid shave. I have no qualms about recommending this shaver to anyone.	2001-06-23

I've used an electric 'foil-type' shaver for the last 15 yrs and decided to try the rotary type. Well, they should have called this the 'pull and tear&quot; instead of the 'lift and cut'.

To my surprise, it is quite painful to get used to this type of shaver. if you can handle the pain, it does cut extremely close. My reason for the 2 star rating. Other than that i would not recommend this type over a good foil electric shaver.	2001-06-18

I received The First Years underarm thermometer as a baby shower gift in 1998.  I also received a Braun ear thermometer at the same shower.  The Braun seemed easier and much faster to use so initally that is what I was using.  After using it several times I realized that it didn't seem to be very acurate.  I ran across the The First Years underarm thermometer in a box of items I had put away after the shower.  I decided to give it a try.  I was so pleased with it that I told every new mom I knew how great it was.  It is easy to read and gives you an acurate temperature in a very short amount of time. If you are using it on an infant it is very simple to hold the childs arm next to his side until the thermometer beeps.  The same is true when your child is old enough to understand simple instructions on how to hold their arm for a few minutes.  It is a little more difficult at that in between age when they don't always understand that they have to sit still of a few minutes.  Overall, I would say this is a must for all moms, new and experienced alike.  ALSO, AN EXCELLENT BABY SHOWER GIFT!!!!	2001-06-16

I recently decided to give electric razors another chance and following some research, I ended up buying another Braun.  After my first shave, I noticed two things: (1) electric razors seem to have improved over the years in terms of their ability to provide a close shave, but not by much; (2) my Braun &quot;Clean &amp; Charge&quot; unit was broken and will probably have to be replaced.  Apparently some flimsy rubber part inside the shaver receptacle has broken off or was missing in the first place.<br />You would be best advised to stay away from this razor but if you are determined to buy one, you probably won't find a better price than Amazon.com's.  It certainly lured me in.	2001-06-15

My leg hair learned that pretty fast.<br />Regrowth is slow - two or three weeks before I reach for Satinelle again.

I'm amazed that so many people think this shaver is so good...   On the bright side, the construction of the unit is great and the shapely unit fits in your hand perfectly.  The LCD features are very cool for the people who like bells and whistles..  And of course, being able to clean it under your faucet is great too.  But there's more to shaving than looks... I tried this unit for a week having used a braun unit before that, and I really had to works at cutting everything which irritated my face a bit...(and my face doesn't irritate easily)  Besides having to work more, those three big heads impress me as having too much surface area to be rubbing on your face at once which just adds to irritation.  But,  if you work long enough, eventually you have a semi decent shave.   After I was done with the norelco, I pulled out my old braun, and found that I could still cut more, and was working a lot less to do it.  Also trimming a line is a bit difficult around beards etc since it's hard to tell exactly where the floating heads are..  Guess what... I'm not done...  The norelco has Ni-Cad batteries which in general does the job, but this is year 2000+ folks... Ni-Cads are dead...  Ni-Cads require they be drained to zero every use otherwise they start to loose their capacity.. I know Braun has switched to Ni MH  batteries that last longer, and do not require the complete cycling requirement... Bottom line... I'm trying a new Braun Sychro Shaver...	2001-06-09

I've switched between Norelco electric razors and blades over the years, never quite satisfied with the shave I was getting.  Norelco has always said \\"shaves as close as a blade or your money back\\".  I've never found this to be true, but the razors were good enough that I didn't return them.  Most recently I used the Gilette Mach 3 razor which does a very good job.<br />Now here's why I give the 6885XL (6886XL is apparently the same model, sold at Costco and other warehouse stores) 5 stars:<br />- Closest shave yet.  This is the first electric razor I've used that shaves as close as a blade (including the Mach 3).  In fact, it shaves closer than a blade under my jaw and around my adam's apple.  I can't shave against the grain with a blade in those areas or my skin breaks out (and that's the only way to get the closest shave.)  With the 6885XL I don't have this problem and I get a really close shave.<br />- It's quiet.  Previous electric razors were so noisy I had to shave in another bathroom so I wouldn't wake my wife.  Not so with this one.<br />- Easy to clean.  Open the top and run hot water through it.  No more brushes (except for periodic maintenance).  An indicator will tell you when it's time to clean.<br />Other features:<br />- Charge remaining (in minutes) display.  This isn't particularly useful to me, but it seems reasonable accurate.<br />- It comes with a stand that holds the razor upright on the counter or basin.  Much neater than the razor just laying around or stuffed in a cabinet.<br />- Hard carrying case, for travel.<br />- Automatically adjusts to different voltages.<br />My wife about had a heart attack when I bought it.  However, it gives me the best shave ever (electric or blades).	2001-06-08

The scale can be customized for different people, allowing you to specify the sex and height for each person.  This profile can be accessed by tapping one of the large buttons on the front of the scale with you toe.  The buttons press easily and I've never had a problem using them with my foot.  Once you get your feet positioned on the scale you will see a readout of your weight and a few seconds after that you'll see a body fat measurement.<br />The main downside I've had with these products is these consistency of the results (bodyfat in particular, not weight).  The bodyfat measurement can fluctuate widely over the course of a day so you must be very careful to take your measurement at the same time every day (the instructions suggest evening is best).  Also, the measurements can be influenced by things such as activity and hydration level.  If you're involved (or even thinking about becoming involved) with physical activity I'd recommend investing in a model with an &quot;athlete&quot; mode.	2001-06-05

I have to admit that, towards the end, I kept hoping it would break down so that I could buy then new 7570.  I finally gave up and shifted it to my office as an emergency backup.<br />My beard is completely self willed.  In some placed it's thin, and in others, heavy.  It grows up, down, east and west with abandon, but little logic.  I generally think of it as an alien monster that lives on my face.  The 7570 is the first razor that has completely conquered the creature.  It just quietly hums along, turning facial hair into dust without ever a burn or a pinch.<br />It includes the ultimate toy for the lazy man, a storage stand that cleans and charges the razor.  And the first LCD panel on a razor.  This not only tells you charge level and reminds you about maintenance, it provides part numbers for the head.  No doubt the next model will include an interface to your Palm V that will record blood pressure and heart rate.  If anyone could do it, it would be Braun.<br />Seriously, the 7570 is a superb piece if precision machinery that does exactly what it was designed to perfectly.  There's no doubt that it is a bit pricey, but this kind of quality will last for decades.  It charges faster than your digital phone and works on a wide range of voltages.  Of course, the real thrill is pretending you'rew the incredibly macho guy in the Braun commercial.<br />On the down side, the cleaning fluid cartidges are hard to find, so order a small pile ahead.  They last 4 to 5 months each.  I haven't tried it yet, but, with a bit of ingenuity it might be possible to refill them.	2001-06-02

The Norelco cut good for about two weeks and then was grossly inefficient, taking a lot of pressure and multiple passes to do a below average job.  In comparison, I thought the remington was pretty good.  After I wore out the remington, I ordered the Braun 5414 and was amazed.<br />Why did it take me so long to realize I needed a new razor?  This thing is SO superior to those other units it isn't even funny.  Mine was cutting like crazy even a split second before it hit my skin!  It cuts really well, and seems to go below the skin line for a superior shave.  I never thought I could get a shave like this.  The pivoting head seems to help too.  There is little vibration and after two weeks I'm still on my first charge.<br />I don't think the more expensive units cut any better, they just hang more gadgets off the same basic razor.  Ok, some of the top end Brauns move the head back and forth to help cut, but I'm not sure that's necessary with the results I'm getting.<br />My wife is thrilled with my close shaves and so am I.  This thing rules!<br />Only drawback is the trimmer is mounted far enough down the body of the shaver that it is more difficult than most to see where you're cutting -- but I can still do what I need to do like trim sideburns and whatnot.<br />I'm rating 5 for a superior product.<br />Slope	2001-05-29

This thing cleans itself in the special included stand.  And this is not a useless gimick...it really works.  No more getting the little brush out and taking your shaver apart.  The cleaning cartridges last a good 5 months or so.  Now to the shave. It is great...close and fast and a joy to use.  Very comfortable on the skin.  The LCD even tells you when to oil the head (just place a drop of machine oil on your finger and let the razor run as you slide your finger over the head).  And, wonder of wonders, the part number for the replacement head is even included in the display.  No more fishing out the owner's manual every 12 months.  I really cannot say enough good things about this shaver, and I have owned them all.  But now I would never own another. It is expensive, but totally worth it.	2001-05-29

It's better than the Norelco but not quite as good as the latest Remington triple-head. Of course, it's not as loud as the Remington either. But, let's face it, if you want a close shave, you're going to have to use a blade and shaving cream or gel. It takes about twice as long (or longer) to get a decent shave with any electric.  However, this shaver is fun because of the cleaning feature and the various LED readouts on the deluxe model. It's hard to rate its longevity because I've only had it a few weeks.  The motor seems to drag where my beard is heaviest.  Also, the fan in the cleaning unit sounds like it's struggling to get up to speed during the drying mode of the cleaning operation.  To sum up: a fun toy but nothing to write home about.	2001-05-25

I just received this spa for my birthday and I am sooooo addicted to it already! I wear high heals a lot for my new job and there is nothing in the world like coming home to soak my feet in this! You fill it with warm water and a heater on the bottom keeps the water the same temperature while in use. You can choose between three options on the control dial. 1. Heat/Infrared/Massage 2. Heat/Infrared/Massage/Bubbles (my personal favorite) 3. Heat/Bubbles. The infrared is the lighted red area on the center console where you can place your foot to receive hot, deep and penetrating direct treatment. I usually rest my heels on it for a few minutes at a time. Above the infrared heat is a little pedicure station. You place a little attachment on the opening and with the pressure of your foot...it spins. There are three attachments...a foot brush, a pumice stone, and a nubby massager. (Refer to the picture to see where the pedicure station is located). The bottom of this foot spa is very nubby...it has lots of acupressure points. Of course you can always lift out the bottom sections and replace them with foot rollers!! Now honestly, doesn't this sound like heaven?  This is great for after a gym workout or for an injury. I love mine because I have an old ankle/foot injury and this really soothes the pain after being on my feet all day. I seriously wish we had a ten star rating; this one deserves it. TIP: I also bought Homedics Paraffin spa. I bought the big one with enough room for feet and hands. I think if you really want to have a home salon...these two products together are perfect. I believe HoMedics is the best brand of foot spas. I asked my friend who's a nurse and she told me HoMedics is doctor recommended. So beware of cheap imitations. I looked at all of them and this one was suggested to me as the best. I'll review the Paraffin Spa soon...	2001-05-10

In fact, I switched back and forth for a few days to make sure I wasn't being biased in any way. For me, the Norelco was much better.  They both give you a suprisingly close shave, but the Norelco just captured more hair in an easier manner around my neck.  I would only recommend the Braun to those who have extremely consistent hair growth (all growing in one direction), which I would think is not very common.   In my case, I just ordered my own Norelco 6885 today and packaging my Braun Syncro tonight for a return.	2001-05-08

You have to wait at least 15 minutes after having a drink for it to even be close to a semi-accurate reading.  This is due to the nature of breathalizers, so it isn't really a fault of the product itself.  It also likes to register a .19 often, even when it is obviously not true.  It is extremely sensitive, and if not used properly will not result in an accurate reading.  It's nice to have, but it might not be what you are looking for.  The size is a nice bonus though.	2001-04-17

I can't rave enough about the Braun Syncro!  It is the best shave I've ever gotten out of an electric.  I will say that the blade is still closer, but you get 95% there without the mess or skin irritation.  The biggest advantage is that you never have to clean or oil it manually.  Just drop it into the Clean &amp; Charge base and forget about it.  It is always clean and ready to go!  This unit also has the longest charge-hold that I've ever seen.  I only need 3-4 minutes to shave each day, so the shaver only has to charge about once every 2 weeks!  There is one drawback that I have found:  The unavailability of the cleaning cartridges.  Hardly anyone carries this little cartridge.  I visited the large retailers in my areaincluding Wal-Mart, Target, and K-Mart and no one carries it.  A Target employee said they did carry them, but wouldn't be stocking them anymore.  I would hate to have to buy them directly from Braun.	2001-04-09

The Braun is clumsy, difficult to adjust and tricky to turn on, which involves pulling the beard guard up just enough to activate the on switch at your beard length setting without pulling the guard off of the trimmer since there is no stop.  It has a swiveling head which means that the head is not firmly attached to the trimmer.  When you pull up too far on the beard guard to turn it on or change the length setting you can pull off not only the guard but the head also, which then drops down on the floor or if you are unlucky on your foot.  It is sharp and it hurts, by the way. The Braun does not do the fine even trimming that the Norelco does, but leaves sort of randomly long hairs.  The beard guard is bulky so you cannot get as close to your nose and ears as you might like.  Compared to the top line Norelco it is a dismal failure but at least you won't have to worry about it too long since you will doubtless break the head by inadvertently pulling it off with the beard guard.  Then you can go out and by a good trimmer.	2001-03-29

The best thing since sliced bread.	I always used either Braun shavers or blades. The blades were a hassle and the electrics didn't cut it, when I hadn't shaved for a few days. I also never liked cordless shavers. Had one and it just didn't feel as 'strong'. The batteries were always weak. This one has all of the above fixed. I don't even remember anynmore where I've put my blades the last time. The batteries last for more then a week of daily shaving, and it runs at full power until the last minute. The display tells you exactly how much shaving time you have left (and it is accurate). The cleaning feature is just the best. No need to use brushes anymore and it always feels fresh and smooth. It even cuts through a long weekend beard with ease. I love it. Some reviewers complained about the bad supply of cartridges. I just ordered mine right here and they are in stock. If you don't clean it every day, but only every other then the cartridge lasts for more then two month.  Compare that with the cost for the overpriced Mach3 blades.	2001-03-25

This is by far the best electric shaver on the market; there really is no comparison. I have tried practically every top end shaver there is out there (the top Norelco models, the top Panasonic models, and Grundig as well) and this beats them all. The closeness of the shave, which is actually closer than a blade if you can believe it, will impress even the harshest of electric shaver critics. The amazing thing is that the Syncro shaves as close as a blade, yet I have never even got the slightest hint of irritation ever, no matter how hard I press on my face (although you don't have to press hard with this shaver, it really does all the work for you). Please don't take my irritation comment lightly, I have unusually SENSITIVE skin, and this is the ONLY shaver of any kind (blades included) that doesn't leave my face irritated. The fact that it shaves as close as a blade and leaves my face as smooth as baby skin (note I have a very thick beard as well) is just a bonus when you consider how gentle this shaver is on your face. This shaver might be a little pricey, but believe me, once you buy you will wonder how you've been living without it. This shaver really is amazing, I recommend it to everyone.	2001-03-23

What I like about this model in particular is the fact that you can wash it under running water. I have been using Norelco shavers since 1985 and my only complaint has been that when the rechargeable battery needs replacing you need to send it to the repair center. This model however has instructions on how to change the batteries yourself.

I highly recommend it as either gift or for personal use.  <br />For the best results I test 10 minutes or so after the last drink since it senses the alcohol level in your mouth.	2001-02-28

This one recomends waiting 30 minutes after having a drink to see what your BAC is.  Our first model did not say that.<br />On the flip side if you are buying this to show your friends they shouldn't drive who cares if you have to wait 30 minutes.  Just don't tell them and when they blow it will read even higher than it should and they'll get a cab which means they will be safe.<br />If you want speand a bit more money but if you are trying just to get people not to drive save the $$$ and get this one.	2001-02-23

Before this I used a Braun foil type razor.  However, the Braun razor always seemed to miss a few whiskers, especially after a couple of days of not shaving, and I would just end up using a straight razor once a week.  The Norelco razor gives a very close shave and manages to get my entire beard even after a few days of not shaving.  I suspect the rotary blades are what makes the difference.  I need to charge the Norelco once a week and each charge lasts for approx. 40 minutes (45 min is advertised but this is the max possible).  Charging takes approx one hour (but I never really timed it).  There is also a quick charge feature where you can have about 3 minutes shaving in about the same amount (3 minutes) of charge time.  Another nice feature of this razor is that it is quiet - much more quiet than my foil razor.  Also, the 6000 series allows the razor to be cleaned by rinsing in water.  This is nice since the first thing I did was to loose the little brush for cleaning the foil razor.  I ended up banging it on the side of the wash basin (not good) and making a big whisker mess.  One other nice feature of the Norelco is there is no switch to flip for European voltage since it converts automatically.  Antoher tip is that you may want to review the Norelco web site to get a good comparison of all the different series.  You may want to go with a slightly cheaper version if you do not need all the LCD displays or the water washable feature or the fancy carrying case.  The Norelco really does provide a close shave and I recommend it.	2001-02-18

I have used electric razors for years.  I have sensitive skin, and can only use a razor/shaving cream once or twice a week, tops.  I used to use a Braun electric razor, but after buying the Norelco Advantage in summer 1999, I'll never go back to &quot;dry&quot; electric razors again.<br />The Advantage is great for so many reasons.  The thing I like best is that you can clean the razor with water.  This is so much better than the air can and brush that I used to use to clean my Braun.<br />As far as the actual shaving process, the ability to use warm water on the razor and then put it on your face is just great, it makes the shaving experience very pleasant.  I also like the lotion packs you can use.  I, myself, use shaving cream while I shave w/ this razor, and like the way it works/feels.<br />The lotion thing might look like a gimick, but you have to realize that this razor is made to run best with some kind of lubrication.  That's why I find the shaving cream/ lotion combo to be the best.  Also, this razor works great in the shower.<br />The lotion refills are about $1 each (they come in five-packs, and are about $5 at Target).   This may seem expensive, but I usually only replace a lotion pack every two weeks or so.<br />The charger is great.  They say to keep it on the charger all the time, but I don't do that.  I just charge it full, and then use it for a while.  I charge it up every two weeks, or so.  But even then, it doesn't even need it.  You could go weeks without charging, it's that good.  I used to bring the charger w/ me on vacation, but I don't anymore.  I just charge it full before leaving, and then throw the razor in my suitcase.  You'll run out of lotion before you run out of power.<br />I have an older version of this razor.  I bought one for my father this past Christmas, and noticed that they updated the body material.  It's now a more rough feel, I guess for better grip.  Also, it's a different shade of blue now.  It's a very nice design.  I love gadgets that are really well designed for both looks and funcationality, and this one has both.  <br />The travel kit that comes with it now is kinda cheap.  When I bought mine in 1999, it came with a really nice travel kit, but now it comes w/ a cheaper feeling case.  But, that's small stuff.<br />I still use a traditional razor (I love the new Schick X-treme) to shave below my chin, just because no electric ever gets that area ever, so I don't fault Norelco for that.<br />I can't really think of any other negatives of this product.  I love this razor, and if you are looking to either replace your current electric, or are thinking of entering the electric razor world for the first time, I know you will not be disapointed.	2001-02-17

All have made the claim of &quot;a shave as close as a blade&quot;.  Although they were all adequate shavers at their time, none actually lived up to the above claim.  I would always use a blade razor from time to time in order to really get that close shave.  Not so with the 5414.  Although I have not seen this claim in their advertising, this shaver truly delivers.  Granted, I have what would be considered a light beard and this might nnot apply to all users, but it certainly works for me.  Also where I grow a number of wild neck hairs that were not removed by other shavers without using the trimmer the 5414 gets them all.  Overall this is the best electric shaver I have ever owned.	2001-02-16

I've been using it know for about a month and I can't say enough about it. I've always used a Norelco shaver but this one is superb. It gives you a nice close shave pretty quickly (just be sure that you face is clean and dry otherwise it might tug a bit on the whiskers OUCH!). One great feature is that you can clean it by running it under warm water. Begone with the little brushes!! The battery holds up pretty well. I can use it for well over a week before having it recharge it. As the battery level decreased, the speed of the shaver does not slow down at all. The speed stayed constant down to the last shave. I highly recommend this shave to anyone who wants a fast, close shave but doesn't want the hassle of shaving cream/gel and all that stuff.	2001-02-09

Braun is a pioneer and leader (well, neck-and-neck with Norelco) of electronic shavers. This shaver gives you an extremely close shave!<br />For several years I used one of the Norelco shavers (three round &quot;heads&quot;) and never knew better.  But when you switch to a Braun, you realize how much closer the shave is.  The pivoting head adjusts to face's contours much better than the Norelco which is sorta' clunky and BIG.<br />Also, the pop-up trimmer for mustache and sideburns is great if your stubble has grown long, or if you want to trim back a little hair.<br />Get this baby... your face will be glad you did.	2001-02-07

Previously I had used a Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver with shaving cream, which gave me a decently close shave, but ended up getting so gunked up with the shaving cream that it would become useless after a month or so.  I then went on to shaving with the Mach 3, and after using the most expensive of creams, aftershaves, and toners, I would still find my face a bloody mess in the morning, especially my neck.  I looked around online and was instantly attracted to the Braun.  I am pleased to say that it does everything that is advertized.  The shaves are clean and quick, and you don't have to worry about the blade dulling after repeated use because of the self-cleaning process.  I do have to say that I recently took the shaver on a two-week trip without the cleaning stand, and I found that even though the machine would tell me when to clean it with the included brush, the shaves would become progressively more painful and less effective.  So those of you thinking about not spending the extra money on a Syncro model with the Clean and Charge Stand, I would recommend reconsidering your options.  This is the component that I have found that makes the product so wonderful.<br />All in all it has drastically changed my morning routine for the better.	2001-02-04

Each of the 10 motors simply vibrates. There is no kneading action whatsoever. There is no manufacturer in the world that makes a 'kneading pad' so don't be disappointed when this arrives.

I bought this razor to replace my old Braun #5415, which I purchased over 5 years ago.  It needed to have the batteries replaced as well as the foil &amp; cutter, so I decided to replace it with the 5416.<br />For my style of shaving it's fast &amp; effective (I touch up with a &quot;Good News&quot; razor after mowing with the electric).<br />According to the Braun Web Page, the main difference between the 5416 and 5414 is that the 5416 first discharges the battery before recharging it.  The 5410 uses standard AA batteries.<br />The main difference between the 5000 series and the 6000 series is that the 5000 is good for 35 minutes and the 6000 for 60-65 minutes of shaving time.<br />You decide whether the extra time is worth the money, as they all seem to be pretty much the same and use the same foil &amp; cutter set.<br />Also, Braun allows you a 30 day trial period.  So if you don't like it, you can return it to them (in the USA) for a refund.	2001-01-28

Blades were always a hastle, with the mess, the nicks, etc...  The rotary shaver just never seemed to get close enough, often it looked like I never shaved.  So, I decided to give a foil a try.  After a lot of research, I decided on this one.  The 30 day money back guarantee gave me the chance to try it out, without having to worry about spending this much on a shaver.  It was WELL worth it.  The first shave was the closest I've ever had and every shave since then has produced the same results.  If I missed a area, I could go over it again with no irritation, unlike a blade.  The self cleaning is terrific, just drop it in and walk away.  The next day I have a shaver that is like new.  The footprint for the stand is a little large if you don't have a lot of room in your bathroom, but the unit is self contained, and you could put it other places (dresser top, night stand, etc...)  Overall, I highly recommend this shaver.	2001-01-19

Like others, I have tried blades and electrics, among them Panasonic and Norelco and found them to be slow at their job or not close at all. The Braun 7570 is the best I have ever used. It shaved as close if not closer than a blade and way better than the electrics I have tried. No more nicks or cuts from blades and much more efficient and faster than the other electrics and I shave a lot both the face and the dome.<br />PROs: Fast close shave, runs on its own charge or plug, Charges fast and runs for long time between charges, LCD display actually displays useful information, Braun Quality. Big bonus feature is the self cleaning cycle, I was never really bothered about cleaning my other electrics, but the Braun does it for you and lubricates the blades too. You can set it to charge or clean or both at the same time, its up to you<br />CONs: I have a goatee and if you need really precise control its no blade.

OK, I'll admit it....I'm lazy. One day I just got really tired of shaving with a blade, not to mention all the money I was throwing away on all the Mach3 junk. I spent about a month researching electric shavers, usually shocked at what some of them actually cost.  For that month, I shaved with a beard trimmer (Ouch!).  Of course it didn't get very close, but I wasn't expecting much more from an electric shaver...boy was I wrong! It came X-Mas time and I decided to ask for the most expensive best-reviewed shaver I could find.  I quickly found the Braun Syncro 7570. First of all, the shaver itself is perfect.  I had never believed that &quot;close as blade&quot; stuff they've been saying for 10 years, but it really is true.  This thing literally shaved as close as a blade, without any irritation or cuts (of course). Second, it is smart.  It knows more about shaving than I do.  It will end up needing less care than most of the things I own. Cleaning is fast, complete, and efficient...the LCD even inverts itself when turned upside down in the cleaning unit so you can still read it.  When not in use, it sits in its cleaner like an old friend, waiting for another visit the next day (or 2 since it gets so close). I advise anyone thinking about going with an electric shaver to give this some serious consideration..I'm glad I did.	2000-12-28

Since age 16, I have been a blade guy. After getting tired of cuts and getting this gift as a surprise from my girlfriend, I must say: Impressive!

I'm a gadget guy, and this one is right up there with the KEWLEST appliances I have seen! The LCD display kicks!	2000-12-20

My first foray into the electric razor world.  Had I to do it again, I would go with one of the rotary brands (with the circular razor heads) rather than with a foil razor like this one.  The reason is that to achieve best effects with these, you need to shave EXACTLY against the grain.  This is hard to do under the neck and around the chin, where the hairs don't grow all in the same direction.  The result is that you have to make several passes over the same area at different angles, which worsens razor burn.  The rotary shavers get around this by cutting in all directions at once.  In short, if you're contemplating a new razor, go with a rotary.  You'll thank me.	2000-12-16

I have compared it with models costing 5 times as much and it compares at least as well if not better than them all.  <br />It could be made better if somehow it would perform the massage autonomously, but if you don't have a good friend or an expensive massage chair, you'll be forced to use the long handle to massage those achy muscles all by yourself.  <br />I wanted to get the cheaper non-heated one but it was unavailable at the time of my order.

Every couple of years I broke down and tried an electric razor.  But I always went back to blades because I never could get a close shave, until now.  This razor really works.  I also like the cleaning function.  No more blowing the cut hair all over the bathroom.  I just put it in the stand and it cleans itself.  About once a month I replace the cartridge.  That is the only cleaning I do.<br />Close shave, no mess.  What more could I want?	2000-12-14

Save your money and go downmarket Norelco.	2000-11-27

So when my son requested a beard trimmer his last birthday, this is the one I bought. At 17, he is experimenting with his &quot;look&quot;---including facial hair.<br />He reports: it's great, having multiple adjustments allows him to &quot;edge up&quot; his thicker moustache and full but thinly lined beard to a precise length. He also uses this well designed trimmer to keep his hairline, especially across the back, exactly as he likes it in between &quot;fades&quot;.<br />Why do I like this trimmer? It keeps my teen looking clean. And, besides soap, there are not too many products at a bargain price I can say that about.	2000-11-26

Not a very good look.<br />Or they'd end up pulling out more hair than they trimmed. Also, not good (unless you enjoy that kind of thing).<br />Just before buying this one I bought one from the Sharper Image. What a badly designed thing that was. You had to snap on several different guards--none of them ever the right length. I took that one right back and traded it for a fan.<br />THIS TRIMMER is great. The design fits comfortably in the hand. The built-in guard (nothing to snap on or lose) is adjustment to many different settings, from a Miami Vice-like stubble, to what I call \\"the mohair\\" look (chicks dig it--at least my chick does), to a longer, but still neatly-trimmed length. At the very longest length, you can even use it to trim the hair on top of your head (if you have any left).<br />This trimmer is fast, and the results are excellent. The little pop-up moustache trimmer is great for trimming in small spaces. <br />The built-in, rechargeable battery only takes a few hours to charge, then lasts a long time. You can also use it plugged in for those times when you've forgotten to recharge, and it works with 120 or 220v. The whole thing comes with a convenient nylon case that holds the trimmer and the cord and makes it easy to keep everything in one place.<br />I have not yet used this to trim any animal other than myself, but I'm sure it would work there, too.<br />Overall, it's just a pleasure to finally have a device which can take me from looking like I just came off of Survivor island to looking civilized. I've recommended it to other bearded friends, all of whom have said it was great--the best they've ever used.<br />I HIGHLY recommend it.<br />Daniel - [...]	2000-11-22

It is not.  I thought it would be heavy duty but its pretty tinny.  The scale is not mechanical, its electronic.  Runs on 2 AA batteries (not included i might add...).  When you step on it calibrates for up to 5 seconds and then the scale needle lights up and moves to the weight.  Cool the first time, annoying the 2nd time - really annoying every time after that.   The memory function seemed like a good idea but again, there is such a delay in waiting for the thing you wont use it.  The digital readout is also too small and not backlit so you cant see it.	2000-11-08

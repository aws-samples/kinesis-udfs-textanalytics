Why would I spend five bucks per latte (and take my chances with the barista's skills) when I can make my own cup of foamy happiness in less than a minute, and for so much less? Answer: I wouldn't. At least not any longer. The Medium Roast coffee pods will satisfy you whether you drink it black or take it &quot;regular&quot; (with milk &amp; perhaps sugar). I like to use one Medium pod and one Dark Roast pod for my first cup in the morning...it makes a nice, fragrant cup that packs a jolt. I'd highly recommend buying a few bags of the Medium Roast and the Dark Roast at the same time. If you're like me, you won't want to run out-your mornings just wouldn't be the same without your Senseo.	2004-07-07

Grocery	5	1	1	N	N	Boost Your Energy Level with Pure Nutrition Supplements	Reviewer: TheRebeccaReview.com from Washington State<br />\\"Every molecule of ALL ONE is pure nutrition. Not a protein drink. Not a meal replacement drink. ALL ONE is formulated with a unique, amino acid bonding process that begins with pure vitamins and minerals.\\" ~All One Container<br /><br />If you hate swallowing or chewing vitamins, then this is an alternative. This is a tasteless powder that can be mixed into milk or juice. To mix this powder fully, use a blender like the Braun immersion blender: ASIN: B00006I4YF, you can find this here at Amazon. You can also use a Tupperware shaker or GNC has shakers that work very well to blend this powder.<br /><br />I like blending a level tablespoon of this powder with one scoop of \\"GeniSoy Soy Protein Shake\\" powder (ASIN: B00014DYAI). I find the flavors of the shake make the flavorless vitamin powder very palatable, although you can simply use just the powder and flavor your milk with vanilla and a bit of honey. The powder has a base derived from the sweet milk of New Zealand dairy cows. However, this mixture is \\"lactose and hormone\\" free.<br /><br />High Potency antioxidants: A, C & E + selenium and bioflavanoids<br />Stress B-Complex + a full gram of vitamin C<br />Full spectrum minerals for easy absorption<br />Valuable trace minerals<br />Essential vitamins<br />Includes iron<br />All nutrients in optimal balance<br /><br />One heaping tablespoon ( 15 grams ) contains:<br /><br />35 Calories, 2g Carbohydrates, 7g Protein, 8,000 IU Vitamin A (Vitamin A Palmitate), 7,000IU Vitamin A (Beta Carotene), 1,000mg Vitamin C, 500IU Vitamin D (Ergocalciferol), 400IU Vitamin E (as d-Alphah Tocopherol Succinate), 5mcg Vitamin K (as Phylloquinone), 25mg Thiamin HCL (B-1), 25mg Riboflavin (B-2), 100mg Niacin (Niacinamide), 25mg Pyrodoxine HCL (B-6), 400mcg Folic Acid (as Folate), 25mcg Vitamin B-12 (Cyanocobaliamin), 25mcg Biotin (d-Biotin), 100mg Pantothenic Acid (d-Calcium Panthothenate), 500mg Calcium (as Calcium Caseinate/Calcium Carbonate, Dicalcium Phosphate-AA Chelate), 200mg Phosphorus(as Dicalcium Phosphate from Calcium Caseinate), 18mg Iron (as Ferrous Sulfate-AA Chelate), 180mcg Iodine (as Potassium Iodide), 200mg Magnesium (as Magnesium Carbonate), 15 mg Zinc (as Zinc Oxide), 50mcg Selenium (as Selenium Proteinate), 0.2mg Copper, 4mg Manganese, 50mcg Chromium, 50mcg Molybdenum, and 99mg Potassium.

This also contains: Hesperidian Complex, Lemon Bioflavonoids, PABA, Choline, Rutin, Lecithink, Inositol, Rice Bran and a base of Papain, Betain (digestive enzymes) and Kelp. There is also 3mg of Maltodextrin.<br /><br />This is a 30-day supply of Vitamins, Chelated Minerals and Amino Acids. It is a High Potency B-Complex formula and contains Anti-oxidants.<br /><br />After just a week of using this product you are going to notice faster muscle recovery after exercise and also find that your skin is just glowing.<br /><br />I recommend this formula to anyone who is feeling worn out, irritable, lacking energy and noticing their skin texture and vibrancy is just not what it could be. Take this with Soy protein powder and you will start to notice increased energy levels and other great benefits.<br /><br />The main reason I chose this \\"Original\\" formula was because I was looking for Leucine, isoleucine and valine, which are good for muscle recovery after a workout. This powder contains: 623 mg Leucine, 332mg Isoleucine and 402mg Valine. So, I thought the original formula would be perfect to add to an after-workout shake.<br /><br />\\"Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been shown to enhance recovery after exercise. The catabolic stage can also produce a feeling of \\"the blahs,\\" which is partly but not entirely related to fatigue. BCAA supplementationhas been shown to counteract this effect, leaving people feeling \\"pumped and powerful\\" after their workouts.\\" ~The Metabolic Plan, pg. 88 (Information originally obtained from the Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness and other sources.)<br /><br />There are 5 main formulas: Original, Rice Base, Green Phyto Base, Fruit Antioxidant and Active Senior.<br /><br />Added Bonus: This company offers a free \\"scoop and shaker cup\\" when you provide a proof of purchase.

Many species of sharks are on the verge of becoming extinct by excessive fishing. Millions and millions of these top predators of the sea are caught, their fins are cut off and the living torsos are thrown over board - still alive, but unable to swim and are condemned to a cuel slow death.<br />We need the sharks alive because they are the top of marine ecosystem and they keep it healthy and in balance. Way more than 200 million sharks are killed annually. More than 47 species are on list of endangered animals.

Well, sorry to disappoint you, but that story is not true.  The first Baby Ruth bars were made by the Curtiss Candy Company, which was founded in Chicago in 1916 by Otto Schnering, who used his mother's maiden name since it was much more American-sounding and would not cause the problems that a German surname would during World War I.  The first confection made by Curtiss was the Kandy Kate, which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate.  Then in 1921 revised the product so that was now a log-shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts, covered in chocolate.  Priced at only five cents, half the cost of competing candy bars, Schnering named it the Baby Ruth bar, which soon became one of the hottest selling candies on the market.<br /><br />Now, the explanation that the candy bar was named for \\"Baby\\" Ruth Cleveland, the former President's first-born daughter, has been the official explanation proffered by the Curtiss Candy Company since the 1920's while the Babe Ruth legend has been the obvious explanation, especially since Ruth had joine the Yankees in 1920 and in 1921, the year the Baby Ruth debuted, he hit a then-record 59 home runs.  However, the idea that the Baby Ruth bar was named after Ruth Cleveland is rather morbid given she died of diptheria at the age of 12 in 1904, seventeen years before the candy bar was named.<br /><br />The more reasonable explanation seems that the Curtiss Candy Company did indeed find a way to link their product to the Yankee slugger who was becoming the most famous person in the country.  Ironically, Curtiss had to fight off a challenge from a competitor who was attempting to market the Babe Ruth Home Run Bar, endorsed by the Babe himself.  The Curtiss claim that the bar was named for Ruth Cleveland was enough to fight off the challenge, since the names were too close to one another to allow the new product to be marketed that way.  The fact that Curtiss maintained for years that the Baby Ruth bar came out before years before Babe Ruth became famous is enough to pop the balloon since in 1920 Ruth had broken his single season home run record of 29 by hitting 54 round trippers.<br /><br />Of course all that matters now is that this is still a classic American candy bar.  Beneath the milk chocolate coating of Nestles popular 2.1 ounce candy bar is a chewy, peanut-covered center, wrapped in a nougat that is really more of a white or blonde fudge.  In terms of caloric ration the Baby Ruth is 46% Carbs, 48% Fats, and 6% Protein.  The candy bar is low in Sodium and very low in Cholesterol, which is good, but high in Saturated Fat, which is supposedly bad (where do people think the taste comes from?).  A large portion of the calories come from the sugars, which is how nature intended it.  If you want a candy bar with actual peanuts in it, the Baby Ruth is still a good choice.<br /><br />Ironically, I did find a Champion Cocker Spaniel named Baby Ruth, whelped in 1892, who was in all probability actually named for President Cleveland's daughter, Ruth, who had been the first child to be born in the White House the previous year.  She was bred by Joseph Smith of Canada and sold to Andrew Laidlaw and became the foundation on which Mepal built one of the strongest kennels in the United States.

In case you are not familiar with it, I must say that you are really losing something great...<br />Dulce de leche is a dessert that can be eaten alone or as a topping (for example, on waffles, bread or ice cream). It is also used a lot in cakes and other pastries, and its savor is sweet. It is made by blending hot milk, sugar, and vanilla, and as a result has some nutritional value. However, the most important thing is that it is mouthwateringly delicious :)<br />Even if this product is extraordinarily good, it is important to choose the right label, because a good one can be guarantee of excellence. In my opinion, &quot;La Salamandra&quot; is one of the few labels that allow you to be certain that what you are going to eat is not only tasty, but also made of  superior quality raw ingredients. &quot;La Salamandra&quot; is very well-known in Argentina, but has also won some prizes in USA. For example, this product won the 2000 Fancy Food Show's Gold Trophy for spreads/sweet toppings.<br />All in all, I advise you to indulge yourself and give &quot;La Salamandra&quot;'s dulce de leche a try.

The can is pressurized with nitrogen, an innovation that Illy introduced in 1933, which will keep the beans fresh.<br />Aroma of the beans is deep and rich, and the oil content is a nice balance - not too much nor too little.  A coarse grind will produce a rich cup of espresso that will rival any you'd be served in Firenze or Roma.<br />We use a 1-cup stovetop espresso maker (see ASIN B00015HNEA), which produces perfect espressos every time.<br />If love espresso, but for some reason have never tried Illy brand, you are in for a treat.

My husband is finicky about olive oil and swears by this brand because it is always fresh, has the 'right' flavor for his Italian palate, and has the perfect balance of fruity and peppery qualities.<br />To clarify the meanings of fruity and peppery, these are two of a large number of qualities associated with olive oils.  In fact, there are 21 qualities, ranging from apple to sweet.<br />The fruity quality of this oil is subtle and indicates that it is made from mature olives that have been properly handled.  This particular brand holds this quality for about a week after you've opened the bottle, after which it slowly loses it.<br />Peppery describes a 'bite' in the back of your throat from a high-quality oil.  This particular brand has a slight peppery quality that is pleasant and compliments the fruity quality.<br />The final quality upon which I judge olive oil is called &quot;harmonious&quot;, which is a way of describing the blend.  Since there is a slight hint of green leaf as well, this and the fruity and peppery qualities are harmonious to my palate.<br />Colavita brand comes from the Molise region of Italy, which is nestled between Puglia and Campania in central Southern Italy. The flavors from this region lack the heavy grassiness that characterize Tuscan olive oils, yet, are more fruity than Greek oils.<br />For value and everyday cooking - no matter how special the dish - this is one of the better oils on the market, and is certainly as good as many of the gourmet ones we have tried.	2004-06-26

Despite the, previous, scathing review from someone who does not even like black licorice...(What kind of dummy eats black licorice and then complains about it tasting like black licorice???)...I have to say that these are very good, fresh and not too sweet little dogs...They are truly the taste of American licorice as opposed to the European varieties that differ in old fashion licorice taste.  The texture is chewy, but not too soft or sticky.  They are a tad less sweet than &quot;See's Licorice Medallions&quot;, but just as flavorful.  The only reason I don't give them a five star rating is because I believe that it belongs to the &quot;King&quot; of all licorices, the discontinued, Heidi/Hershey dome shaped drops, with the imbossed diamond on the top. They were what real, old fashion, American licorice was all about and what made several generations of Dentists rich with their, &quot;near Ju-Ju-Be&quot; chewy-ness and deep licorice flavor... I'd sure appreciate it if someone were to start making them again! In the meantime, these little black dogs will impress the licorice lover, but not the dummies who eat what they don't like!	2004-06-26

And I sure wouldn't share, even with my best friend, if I had possession of the very last bar on Earth.<br />The original FLAKE by the same manufacturer is comprised of long, pale, crumbly flakes of an intense chocolate pressed into a stick, the long axis of the flakes being parallel to the long axis of the bar. This is a fragile treat liable to fragmentation within the wrapper if handled roughly, e.g. tossed haphazardly into the backpack or briefcase at the beginning of the day. DIPPED FLAKE solves this problem by being protectively enrobed from end to end in thick milk chocolate.<br />Biting through the firm outer coating, one's tongue encounters the interior layers that melt in the mouth in a rush of endorphins. This isn't a treat dandied-up with raisins, nuts, crisped rice, or other sissy stuff, but a robust confectionery designed for the no-nonsense chocoholic. It's almost better than Getting Lucky.<br />Let's be clear about the nutritional implications, shall we? This little magic wand of sugar, fat, and calories is probably not what the Healthy-Eating Gestapo had in mind as accompanying the daily intake of fruits, veg, tofu, and vitamin supplements. Especially if you find yourself courting ecstasy by wolfing down a half-dozen at a time. But, not being totally unreasonable, I wash down mine with non-fat moo. One can't be too careful.<br />DIPPED FLAKE, in my opinion, puts to shame all those Swiss, Belgian, &quot;organic&quot;, and designer chocolates best left to the poncy shoppers crowding Rodeo Drive or Harrods. DIPPED FLAKE may be difficult to find, and you might have to resort to Web order, but it's worth every byte of your on-line credit card transaction.	2004-06-23

So I recommend advanced oral hygiene if you're going to enjoy &quot;Skittles&quot; fruit flavored candy.	2004-06-20

I liked it so much that upon my return to<br />Seattle I immediately checked for the machine's availability in the<br />United States and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com.  Last week I<br />bought the Senseo machine along with four boxes of medium roast<br />decaffeinated pods.  I also received one package of regular medium roast<br />and one package of mild roast with the Senseo machine.<br /> To my horror all of the coffee I received is a very poor<br />substitute of the Douwe Egberts coffee I enjoyed so much in Holland.<br />The coffee that was delivered to me is weak and tasteless.  In fact, to<br />get halfway decent coffee I have to use two pods for one four-ounce cup.<br />This is unacceptable not only from the point of view of expense, it also<br />limits the use of the machine to one four-ounce serving at the time.<br /> I request that you provide Senseo coffee machine users here with<br />the same quality coffee you sell in Holland (at $16.99 for a four-pack<br />of pods it is more than twice as expensive here, which I'm willing to<br />pay only if the coffee is of the same superior quality).  Starbucks is a<br />huge success in this country because it sells real coffee, not some<br />watered-down version of the real thing.<br /> Until I receive quality coffee to substitute for the poor coffee<br />I now have, I will tell my friends, neighbors, colleagues and anybody<br />else who might be interested not to invest in the Senseo machine.  In<br />the meantime I would be happy to return the coffee to you because I have<br />no use for it.  Please let me know when and how you expect to remedy<br />this situation.  If I do not hear from you within a week or so I will<br />return the Senseo machine and the remaining unused portion of the coffee<br />to Amazon.com for a full refund.<br /> I look forward to hearing from you.	2004-06-14

I love the taste, and at first it did not taste too hot (odd because it is supposed to be one of the hottest sauces you can buy). But about 4 minutes later the heat really kicked in, and it was about as hot as Daves Insanity Sauce. What I love most about this sauce is the taste. They made it so you can really enjoy the taste before the heat kicks in and makes your taste buds inoperable. <br />Oh, this sauce is thin. So if you are used to Daves or 100% Pain, don't just pour thinking it will come out like think catchup. The first time I poured it on a burrito, I got about three times as much as I wanted because the sauce is so thin.

If you get this sauce for the first time, I would take a edge of a toothpick and dip it in the sauce, and get the smallest amount on your tounge. It will burn for a good 10 minutes. This will let you know exactly how hot this sauce is. While I would bet most people use this sauce as an additive in other foods like salsa or chili, I like to put it on burittos (the football sized ones from mexican resturants), about one drop every third bite. But if you eat it that way, be prepared to pay the price. Your mouth will burn with no relief in sight. Your sinuses will clear and your nose will run uncontrollably. Your eyes may turn red, and you might have a hard time breathing. And don't forget about that second burn, the next time you use the toilet (that is a serious warning. I was at a mexican resturant with a friend who ate dave's on his burrito. Dave's kicked in and he had to go. Everyone in the resturant could hear him howling in pain while he was in the bathroom). I only know of one other person who can eat the sauce as a sauce. Everyone else who has tried it has begged for an ambulance or help. It is that hot. And I love it.<br />One other note. If you use it as an additive, a little will crank up the heat level of most foods. If you don't think the hot salsa from the grocery store is hot, a few drops of this will make that salsa much hotter. But do yourself a favor, and make your own salsa. It is easy. I chop up two jalepenjo peppers, a onions, a can of diced tomatoes, maybe subsitute a chipolte if i want more sweetness, the juice of a lime, and a dash of dave's. Salt it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. After an hour, drain the liquid into the blender, and add in one more can of canned tomatoes. Blend it, and then add it back to the salsa mixing it up. For something different, chop up a bit of mint for the salsa. It will give an odd taste. Your mouth will burn as you breath out, and cool as you breath in.	2004-06-08

Tried this on pork steaks -- used half a bottle.  I was amazed.  The rest of the sauce is waiting for a worthy meal.<br />  I picked this up while on vacation 450 miles away from home.  Now I'm loathe to use the other half of the bottle -- because I can't just buy it at the local grocery store.<br />It's almost like Elaine of Seinfeld determining if her suitors are sponge-worthy.  Except I wonder if my meals are sauce-worthy.  To use the sauce, the meat and the rest of the meal will have to be special enough to be sauce-worthy.<br />Is it worth $9 a bottle?  Yes!  But I'm still cheap and I would use it infrequently because of the price.  I'd rather try to duplicate the recipe.  If it were $4-5 per bottle, I'd use it all the time.	2004-06-06

I had the fortune a couple of years ago to have a coworker bring in some of this tea that she had purchased on a trip to Seattle.  It quickly supplanted every other tea we had at work and threw us into a fit of doldrums when we began to run low.  Fortunately another coworker had relatives living in the area and were coming down for a visit, so a conjoling plea was able to provide us with months more supply of this tea.  Then it too ran out.<br />Fortunately, however, they included ordering information with the last supply, but that didn't stop me from bugging anyone I possibly knew with relatives, friends or even people in town from Seattle to see if I could cajole my way to more of this very excellent tea!<br />It's a nice, flavorful tea that is at once sweet without being sweetening.  It also works as a half-half blend with regular black tea to bring up the flavor and sweetness of black tea and minimizing the natural flavor of this tea.  We enjoy it iced, but it works well hot also.  I am both excited and pleased to see that it is being offered to a wider market and urge anyone that has even the slightest love for tea to order this product now!<br />(I, of course, use nothing but the loose leaf variety)	2004-06-06

After a friend of mine let me try his &quot;Dave's Insanity Sauce&quot;, and I loved the heat kick. Since Dave's can only be purchased on-line, I had a limited choice from my grocery store. I was suprised to see Ass Kickin' Cajun Hot Sauce on the shelf, and from looking at the name I guessed it would be hot. Well, after trying it on a burrito, I can say it is not that hot. And the bottle only lets you put a drop on at a time. I spent more time trying to get hot sauce out than eating. And since it was not as hot as I wanted, I kept putting more and more on tyring to get some heat which lead to another problem- the taste of vinigar was too strong. Too bad, I was looking forward for something really hot. I guess I will have to wait for my internet order to come it.

Due to some strange combination of genetics and ethnicity, I've been shaving since junior high, i.e., about 34 years now, and it goes without saying that it's become a chore.  Occasionally, depending on my schedule, my Mediterranean swarth (I'm half Italian) requires a twice-daily pruning, which holds about the same appeal for me as listening to those &quot;American Idol&quot; kids' endearingly bad grabs for the brass ring.  While Gillette's shaving gel can't do anything about reversing my hirsuteness, it does make shaving a whole lot easier to take (I'll stop short of using the term &quot;enjoyable&quot;).  A very small dollop of this stuff produces much more foam than needed and it goes on easy, conditions and lubricates the skin, and smells great.  I've tried about every shaving product out there, both foam and gel, and this one is as dependable as the tides.  Highly and unqualifyingly recommended.	2004-05-27

Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey's milk chocolate.  Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry.  Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments.  In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each.  During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores.  After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity.  In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese's Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br />In 1992 Reese's started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese's bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products.  Now even have White Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making.  But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \\"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\\" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups.  You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator.  But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies.  Or you can buy this 36-count box and just enjoy eating them.  Fortunately these are 2 cup packages, because my way of eating Reese's Peanut Butter Cups is to eat them all.  Open up a wrapper with four cups, I eat four.

I was fascinated by the thin layer of ash that runs through the center before I even tasted it. She served a tiny wedge of it to me with a few slightly sweet crumbly wheat crackers. This is hands down the most delicious and unusual goat cheese I've ever tasted. The odd thing is that I would never have identified it as goat cheese; it's smooth, a bit sticky in some parts, though more crumbly and chevre-like in other parts. The ash is, somehow, a tasty counterpoint -- in addition to lending a romantic touch that remarkably captures the feel of an early fog-bound morning in Northern California.<br />If I could have a Personal Official Cheese, this would be it.	2004-05-21

Well I suppose, if you must eat microwave popcorn, this is the stuff to eat.  Yet remember, just because it is organically grown does not make it good for you-- it hasn't got *as many* chemical additives, but for it to stay fresh it needs to have some, probably more than you think.  A better, healthier alterative would be to pick up and air popper and some seeds.  This solution will also save you money over time and I gaurentee it will taste better than anything you can mirowave.	2004-05-21

Definitely one of the best teas ever, although its smokiness may make it an acquired taste for some.  I recommend buying it in small quantities, as it definitely does not improve with sitting around.  It is imperative to preheat your teapot and your mug, and don't make this with anything but BOILING water from your kettle--if your water, pot, cup are not hot that nasty overtaste develops quickly with this tea.  But it's easy to brew it HOT, then add a little sugar (I especially like natural sugar here), sit back and enjoy.  Nothing more warming on a cold day.	2004-05-20

They have to charge that much because there are very few ads. I do not deign to call this publication a magazine.  It is more a chronicle of current issues and the relevant data.  It is extremely heavy on fact, and I find myself better informed on many issues than other periodical readers.  The Economist's point of view is neither that of an American liberal nor that of an American conservative, but rather a particularly British liberalism, one more akin to classical liberalism.  Both Democrats and Republicans are bound to be challenged when encountering data and perspectives in this publication.  This publication is the most globally focused I know, covering the US, UK, Asia, the Middle East, Technology, Business, Finance, and more very thoroughly. American readers will be delighted by the wry British humor scattered about in picture captions and stashed away in articles. If you want to find real data, and not just read op/ed pieces, this is a great publication, written for you, the intelligent generalist.	2004-05-19

However, I took a chance while they were on sale here at amazon.com few month ago. After brewing my first cup of espresso with the pod, I realized that I will probably run out them very soon! With those pods, you can brew great tasty espresso with professional coffee shop quality. It tasts strong but not bitter, nor sour. The coffee is well-roasted with full-body flavor.<BR>Most important is that it is so convenient!! Before using those pods, one shortcoming about using non-auto espresso machine was that I had to spend few minutes to wash those coffee away and carefully put coffee into the small holder before make another cup of espresso. It's always messy and time consuming! After using those pods, all I have to do for making next cup of espresso is picking up the pod and put a new pod. It's quick and clean. Now I can really enjoy my espresso.	2004-05-18

It is all natural and doesn't contain any preservatives. You can use this flour for bread machine baking too and it produces superior results. I've used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because I didn't have any \\"gluten\\" as called for in the recipe. If you substitute 1 ½ cups of regular bread flour for part of the whole wheat flour you don't seem to need the gluten.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill products remind me of my childhood when my father took me to the Graue Mill in Oakbrook, IL where we watched corn being milled. It is now the only operating waterwheel gristmill in Illinois. While Bob's Red Mill products don't arrive in a cloth bag, the paper bags do have an old fashioned feel and have a string-sewn closure. I love the crinkly sound of the high-quality paper bags.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill uses slow turning, 100-year-old millstones to naturally grind together the bran, endosperm and germ that contains the nutritious oil. This is a \\"cool stone grinding process\\" which preserves nutrients normally lost in high-speed, high-heat milling.<br /><br />This company produces more than 400 products. Look for everything from hot cereals and mixes to flour milled from a wide variety of grains.

I have tried both the dark chocolate and milk chocolate versions, and found the milk chocolate version to be my preference.  (I generally prefer dark choclate because of the rich full chocolate flavor.)  The Yamate milk chocolate was as rich and full flavored as most dark chocolates, so I was more than pleased - and satisfied - with the milk chocolate version.  I did find the chocolate so rich that, a full slab later, I was on a strong caffeine buff, so buyer beware; this is the real thing.  The sweetener, maltilol, luckily has no effect on me.  I avoid products containing sucralose (Splenda) because this sweetener messed up my liver enzymes big time, and made me ill and nauseous.  (On a side note, fellow low carb dieters, please do your research on sucralose; my doctor thought it was my lipitor that was affecting my liver - turned out it was sucralose.)  So, the Yamate Chocolatier milk chocolates are ideal for me on my low carb diet, and meet my demands for a rich, European style, genuine chocolate product which I can relish on my diet.	2004-05-10

It can be used when Clicker training or training a cat by other positive reinforcement methods.<br />Do suggest that you order more than one bag, and, if possible, a bigger bag or other products from this company to offset the minimum shipping charge.<br />Shipping is a bigger problem when ordering bonito as cat treats from some online cat supply companies--as if you order only the typical .25 oz container you can pay about $5.00 shipping--thus doubling the cost. <br />So if ordering a bag for yourself, also ordering some for your cat(s), &amp; some more for your friends who cook Japanese food as well as your friends with cats significantly lowers the shipping cost per item.	2004-05-07

Once you've tasted this high quality Dutch coffee, you'll never go back to American/Columbian nor that burnt stuff sold in those bookstores. Hopefully prices for the coffee will come down. For now, it's cheaper for my friend to ship me Senseo coffee from Holland (package of 18 pads there is less than 2 Euro) than to buy it here in the States or online. Now I will celebrate SENSEO DAY, the day I received my Senseo machine (tho it arrived without the free coffee cups) every year!	2004-05-07

Grocery	5	7	7	N	N	Delicate Minty Flavor	Used after meals and snacks, it (Xylitol) can stop the formation of tooth decay (cariostatic). ~John Peldyak, DMD<br /><br />If you are looking for a \\"natural\\" sugar free chewing gum, this is an excellent choice. Not only does it not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion.<br /><br />I'm very impressed with this gum because the flavor lasts and lasts. I find myself throwing out the gum and it is still minty after chewing it for any length of time.<br /><br />Ingredients: Xylitol (sweetner), Gum Base (original latex from sapodilla trees), natural flavor, gum Arabic, lecithin, glycerin, beeswax, carnaubawax.<br /><br />Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day. It is commercially manufactured from \\"xylan hemicellulose\\" sources such as Birch trees in Finland.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />Of Interest: In a placebo-controlled study, Xylitol gum was effective in reducing the risk of developing ear infections by a full 40%. This is the gum to give to your children!<br /><br />Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30 g per day can cause stomach discomfort. A few pieces a day after meals would seem to be best.<br /><br />The advantages of Xylitol are overwhelmingly positive and chewing this gum would almost seem to be a requirement for good dental health.<br /><br />This gum is HIGHLY recommended for health advantages and the amazingly fresh minty taste The minty taste lasts long after the gum is no longer sweet. This is a good gum to chew after meals for about 10 minutes.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-05-07

Unlike the more famous roquefort, D'Auvergne is slightly milder, with less of an after-flavor.  It does not overpower one's tastes and is a good choice for those looking for the strength of a french Bleu but wishing to avoid offending delicate palettes.  <br />This cheese is made from Sheep's Milk and contains the famed veins of blueish bacteria that give the cheese its signature flavor. This Blue was not wet nor sticky as many of the trendier Blues of late seem to have become. Neither has it the overly dry texture of say an English Blue Stilton, a traditional holiday Blue cheese on its own or in combination with the English Gloucster Cheddar and referred to as &quot;Huntsman&quot; cheese, whcih is very pretty, but suitable only as a dessert cheese or for afternoon Tea owing to its dryness.<br />Blue D'Auvergne, on the other hand, has a subtle creamy texture without being overly moist. Some Bleus err on the side of moistness now to the point of being more similar to a triple-creme.  Not so this Bleu. D'Auvergne slices well with the proper cutlery and can be crumbled if you'd like it that way.  It melted well atop a pear tart we made and complimented the sandy sweetness of the pears wtihout overpowering their delicate flavor &amp; scent as a Bleu such as Roquefort would have easily done.  This is a fine addition to the French Bleus and it was a pleasure to have on hand at a time when rich foods were bieng served and the D'Auvergne could be used to sprinkle atop a lightly seared Filet mignon with a sultana reduction sauce or tossed into a simple salad of dandilion greens, leftover crushed walnuts,and nasturtium vinegrette. The possibilities are endless.<br />This cheese was not too rich but was just rich enough to enhance any dish it graced. It's light tang was never overpowering, rather it added a gentle dash of excitment to the foods with which we paired it. Although there was none left over for a simpler dish, I would have loved to have tried it on its own either with wine or as part of a fruit plate.  I look forward to getting more of this fine cheese.	2004-05-07

It is a newspaper (albeit on a macro level), a political primer, a science journal, an arts review, an economic/finance tutorial, and much more.  It is incredibly dense - a typical issue is over 100 pages, and is primarily words, supplemented with descriptive charts and graphs, not fluffy half-page pictures like in many other magazines.  However, despite its length, it never is burdensome to read.  All articles are written for the &quot;intelligent layperson&quot;, which means you always come away from an issue knowing a bit more about a whole bunch of subjects.<br />If the Economist replaced Time magazine as the leading periodical in North America, IQs would go up 20 points.	2004-05-06

When I first became obsessed with Indian cooking, I taught myself from books, and did everything by hand, including roasting and grinding my own spice blends from whole spices.  (If you want to teach yourself Indian cooking, check out my &quot;So You Want To...&quot; guide for helpful cookbooks.)  Since then, I have tried many pre-made spice blends, most of them lacking in flavor when compared to what I make myself.  And then I found Neera's Garam Masala on the shelf at the market, and discovered that this amazing product is as intense, lively and flavorful as the garam masala I used to spend HOURS making.  HOORAY!!  I was very happy to find it online at Amazon, because the markets I shop at do not carry specialty products consistently, so I was becoming frustrated when I couldn't find a new jar as my old jar was starting to look empty.  DOUBLE HOORAY!!  This is great stuff, and now I never have to be without. :)	2004-05-06

While I find marshmallow repugnant in nearly all forms, save for s'mores, I have to admit that there's something deeply comforting in the gooey center of these pies. Every once in a while I find myself reaching for a Moon Pie just to get a taste of what treats were like in a simpler time. It takes you back to when people didn't obsess over the fact that a single Moon Pie and an RC cola had all the calories you were supposed to take in over the course of a week. It is the flavor of a lazy Tennessee summer afternoon, made so sweet as to distinguish from the sweet waft of breeze through the purple iris blowing down from the mountains. It's the lilt of twanging banjo and the dribble of a nearby creek. It's another southern cliche that somehow remains untouched by time.	2004-05-04

This bread is therefore quite closer to a South Beach Diet-acceptable &quot;dessert&quot; versus something you'd get in a typical bakery (with the possible exception of the molasses...didn't read that far).<br />The raisins were sweet and delicious and the bread is rich and hearty. I paid $1.99 locally and found it to be a very good value. It was flavorful and delicious enough by itself that butter actually was a negative when I tried it!

Grocery	5	40	42	N	N	The Princess of Hot Stuff	&quot;Hime&quot; is &quot;Princess Brand&quot; and it is a big seller in Japanese and Korean grocery stores. This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi, used for sushi, sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes.<br />One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside-down. Yes, that's what I said, turn it over. The paste will stick in the bowl, and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot, hot, hot are retained, improving the bite. Get that wasabi buzz.<br />I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust. Or being short on time, I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling. Hot and sweet. Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke, or tea-rice. Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl, put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips. Pour hot green tea (bancha) over and drink like a soup. Said to be a cure for hangover (I wouldn't know, but they say it works.)	2004-04-23

Great in salads	Za'atar is a mixture of herbs and sumac berries (sour due to naturally occuring malic acid on the surface of the berry. Malic acid is the sour used in those popular sour candy treats like Sour Patch Kids, or the &quot;vinegar&quot; flavor in vinegar-and-salt potato chips.) The mix of resinous herbs like thyme and the sour sumac make a zippy seasoning that is a great substitute for SALT and absolutely wonderful in salads and on pita. If you haven't had za'atar in Middle Eastern foods, you can compare the taste to a lemon and Provence herb mix.<br />I use za'atar two ways: one, on a quick appetizer or finger food for guests. Take pita breads, split to single sheets. Brush with GOOD olive oil and sprinkle with za'atar. Bake until crisp, and cut into wedges. (I bake at a 500 degree oven sometimes to make a kind of melba toast, but you must use a LOT of oil and you must watch like a hawk. ) You can also brush with oil and za'atar and heat in a toaster oven.<br />I also use it in Lebanese salad.

It is a resinous (piney) aromatic bitter-sweet spice, rather intense. The green papery pods are broken open, and the dark seeds inside can be pulled out and ground in a mortar for use in breads, cookies, curries, puddings, chai and the like. It is the spice of &quot;kheer&quot;--Indian rice pudding, where sometimes the whole green pods are thrown in. I use it in tea or even coffee, bruising the black seeds slightly with the pestle. It is also commonly used in pilau (pilaf) or biryani, that festive Indian rice and meat or vegetable cassarole. Scandinavian cooking uses this spice in many cookies and cakes.<br />If you aren't used to the flavor, it can be a bit startling--not sweet and spicey like cinnamon or nutmeg. The pods are a nuisance to process, but the volatile essential oils are so fugitive that it's better to put up with the job of extracting the seeds than to use ground cardamom that will just lose its scent. Rather like the difference between fresh grated nutmeg and powdered.	2004-04-23

Grocery	5	1	1	N	N	Good and good for you	The flax seed, when expanded by moisture (in your tummy or in a bowl of water) has a gummy fiber that is extremely good for your health. It is said to remove cholesterol (don't know if this is true) and certainly contributes to the necessary fiber in the diet. In Europe, it's common to find a bowl of these small, dark, sesame-like seeds on the breakfast table to be strewn on muesli. They are also commonly baked into or on top of breads.<br />I use them in a kind of no-grain muesli. I grate an apple, mix it with plain yogurt, and add a couple of teaspoons of flax, sunflower, and pumpkin seeds. This mush is pretty close to Bircher Muesli, but no sugar nor oatmeal or other grains. So it's low carb but very like cold cereal. If you can't even eat an apple on a low carb regime, use grated jicama or even cabbage or cucumber instead, and some lemon.	2004-04-23

But the dark roast is quite good.  Its on the Starbuck-type bitter side, but not as strong.  None of these single serving coffee machines will taste like fresh ground.  That is why you get some one star reviews for the Senseo.<br />I keep the Senseo in my office for hassle-free single servings and it is great for that.  Even the dark roast is really not strong enough to qualify as espresso, so I suggest you just use the double packets and make a large cup.<br />Here is a further hint.  Use a 10 oz cup, not a standard 8.  Then put your milk in the cup and microwave for 30 seconds BEFORE you make the coffee.  After coffee is make make sure to stir with a stirrer.  Stirring is important and is actually recomended by Philips.<br />As long as your expectations are down to earth you should enjoy this product.  The machine itself has been flawless and doesnt seem flimsy at all.	2004-04-19

However, it has better uses than serving directly with meat. For a start, it doesn't really go with strong game or red meat: it is better with goose, turkey, duck or guinea fowl (or maybe squab...). However, it makes a much nicer accompaniment if you whisk it into the roasting juices with a little wine, port or sherry and serve it as a sauce, rather than spooning it straight onto the plate. It is perhaps best used in baking, in coffee gateaux and chocolate or chestnut tortes, and in the traditional French Buche de Noel. If you're feeling decadent, try a little with rice pudding (a novel way to confuse the traditionalist British and irritate the purist French all at the same time). I particularly like using it as part of a glaze or garnish for carrots or roast parsnips, and it can be good mashed into swede, of all things. Jane Grigson has a very strange recipe for a dessert with raw carrot and this stuff, which is excellent, if you're adventurous. However, it is very rich, and depending on what you want to do with it (baking tends to use larger amounts), this container might be too big for you, and once it's opened you might find yourself desperately trying to use up the wretched stuff before it goes off. However, necessity is the mother of invention, and at least it stimulates your creative talents.	2004-04-19

Douwe Egberts makes some of the most delicious European coffee. When the Senseo Single Serve Coffee Maker was created, these single use, disposable coffee 'pods' fit together like hand in glove. 5,000,000 European coffee lovers cannot be wrong...Senseo Douwe Egberts is outstanding, fresh tasting coffee, and each imported 4 pack, (72 Single-Serve pods), comes attractively packaged in a resealable pouch.<br />Medium roast is apt to be a particular favorite for American coffee tastes. It has a rich, full-bodied flavor, neither bitter nor astringent. The Senseo coffee machine can make 1 4 oz cup, 2 4 oz cups, or a single 8 oz cup at a time. The self-contained pods use a tea bag filter-type paper and are approximately 2&quot; in diameter.<br />Right now, the price averages 25 cents per 4 ounce cup. The Senseo makes it with a bit of frothe on the top, and this medium roast coffee is fine straight up, or try it with a little sweetner and a dollop of Hazelnut creamer as I do.<br />I do envision the price point coming down a bit, as the Senseo system becomes the US equivalent of the European sensation. Douwe Egberts recommends using your pods within 2 weeks, however, I've had good luck storing the extras in the freezer section of my refrigerator with no dicernable flavor change.	2004-04-16

Grocery	1	1	1	N	N	When smart consumers turn gullible	Take any positive reviews of this product with a huge grain of salt!<br />It's amazing that people are suckered into buying this product.  The active ingredients listed on the package are &quot;Anas Barbariae Hepatis Et Cordis Extractum 200 CK HPUS&quot;  For most folks unfamiliar with Latin, that sounds like it's gotta be some miracle drug, right?  Here's the true story.<br />Since 1925, Oscillococcinum has been prepared as follows. Into a one litre bottle, a mixture of pancreatic juice and glucose is poured. Next a Barbary duck (that's the &quot;Anas Barbariae&quot;) is decapitated and 35 grams of its liver and 15 grams of its heart are put into the bottle (that's the &quot;Hepatis Et Cordis&quot;).  After 40 days in the sterile bottle, liver and heart disintegrate into a kind of goo, which is then diluted with water into the entire world production of Oscillococcinum for the year.<br />There's no logical reason to believe that anything in duck liver or heart will be an effective flu remedy. But even if there were some magic substance, the manufacturing process guarantees that it will not be in the finished product. The laws of chemistry indicate that after the 12th dilution, it is unlikely that a single molecule from the original organs will remain.  Moreover, at the dilutions that Boiron indicates on their packaging (that's the &quot;200 CK HPUS&quot; part) the concentration of the original substance would be 1 part in 100^200, which is a 1 followed by 400 zeroes. A 1 followed by 100 zeroes is called a googol. The estimated number of particles in the universe that we can see is a googol, give or take a few zeroes. So in order for one of the original duck molecules to be present in a container of Oscillococcinum, the mass of that container would have to be about a googol googol googol times our world, which would be incomprehensibly larger than the visible universe.<br />A little research is all it takes to discover that there isn't a SINGLE reputable scientificstudy demonstrating the efficacy of this product.  And even assuming that the &quot;active ingredients&quot; (duck heart and liver) have any effect on the flu, remember that by spending your $16 on a container of goose liver pate and crackers, you'll be a dose of duck organs that's billions of times stronger than what goes into this so-called &quot;drug&quot;.  All things considered, your money is better invested in a flu shot BEFORE flu season starts.	2004-04-11

The weekly has since been staple reading for me and believe it or not, when I do not have time to read the local newspapers in any detail, The Economist more than make up for this in its wide news coverage. It is a constant companion on my daily subway rides and yes, each article is short, succinct and not to mention, extremely well-written. There is the occasional biasness in a few of its articles but generally, it is a far more objective newsmagazine than what you will normally find in other weeklies. The Surveys are extremely good with a wide range of topics. That also provides food for thought and discussion. Overall, the magazine has improved from its past dowdy appearance to one that is more colorful and snazzier without compromising on quality. I tried to wean myself off the magazine twice but eventually missed it so much that I resumed my subscription for blocks of 3 years !	2004-04-10

Sadly in America have no weekly news magazine that comes within miles of The Economist. This magazine has been around for over 150 years, and the experience shows.<br />I have been a subscriber for 25 years. My college political science professor declared &quot;The Economist has better intelligence than the CIA&quot;. I picked up a copy and have been a loyal subscriber since. I challenge anyone to read a few issues at a local library and then pick up Time or Newsweek and marvel at the difference in content, style, and perspective. You won't go back.<br />It is true that the magazine is conservative in the classical sense, but this perspective is in no way limiting. It's ok for a magazine to have a point of view. The writing is tight, intelligent and aimed at thinking adults. The analysis is first rate.<br />The regular &quot;surveys&quot; are a treat. These are in-depth collections of articles on a particular country or other topic (such as technology). Beyond the current affairs reporting, the Arts and Science sections very often contain information I don't see elsewhere for a year. The weekly obituary often illustrates the life of someone you haven't heard of, in the process introducing you to a previously unknown slice of history or art.<br />The Economist simply has no equal! Read it and liberate yourself from mediocre journalism. Life is too short to read Newsweek.	2004-04-08

I grew up in Chicago in an area full of German Import Deli's and this cheese is wonderful. Typically you grate the cheese (which is why often this cheese is also known as &quot;Reibekaese&quot; or grating cheese), and then you mix the grated cheese with butter or margerine before spreading it on bread or crackers. This allows you to control how &quot;herby&quot; your final cheese is. Adding a lot of Sap Sago to a little butter makes for a very sharp tasting cheese, less Sap Sago, of course, makes it milder,  but its always full of flavor.	2004-04-08

It's made out of a decent weight metal, like the old gum ball machines, and works as you'd expect.<br />There is only one problem.  The machine has the habit of &quot;catching&quot; the jelly bellys as you turn the crank and you end up getting a mangled jb or a partial jb.  Seems like the internal mechanism could have been engineered to prevent crushing or damaging the jelly bellys.  I'd say one out of every 20 jbs end ups getting crushed or cut up on average.<br />As a result, the chute where you retrieve the candy can get messy from all the damaged jelly belly shards.<br />My only other minor complaints would be that it only dispenses 2-3 jelly bellys at a time (although this could be a blessing considering how addictive the jbs can get), and the chute to retrieve the jbs is a little small making it difficult to fish out the candy with adult fingers.	2004-04-07

It definitely read like a pretty scholarly paper...and talk about a classic title for a paper!  For those who &quot;just want to know,&quot; that's the paper to read it seems.	2004-03-31

If I had known the tea would virtually disappear off the face of the earth I would have bought the store out.  This tea is perfect by itself and absolutely delectable with cream and honey.  It's all you need for dessert.  The maple and vanilla combine for a smooth rich taste.  My husband accidentally served my last tea bag to company and I thought I would die.

I have been expanding my vocabulary immensely because they do not write down to the lowest denominator reading their magazine.<br />It has a BBCish feel of openness, delight, and wonder mixed with British humor. But don't let that fool you. It is there meerly to cheer up some of the most thoughtful and thorough analysis of economics, politics, foreign affairs, and anything else important affecting the world. The magazine is weekly, so articles are timely as well.<br />Their credibility is impeccable. There is no discernable bias in my opinion, save a pro free market stance. This is very appealing in a world where I cannot even think of another news source of which I believe to be politically unbiased.<br />The recent train bombings in Madrid were an issue on which I wanted to see the Economist's take. Conservatives are claiming Spain is appeasing terrorism, while liberals are defending Spain as exercising its democrat free rights to choose its government... and of course, as is the standard today, neither are willing to give an inch on their positions. The Economists response was the typical, yet satsifying, &quot;Well, on the one hand...&quot;	2004-03-23

The roasted tomato flavor has a pleasant &quot;thereness&quot; in the chipotle version.  The cilantro is also discernible.  Exacting foodies may be disappointed that the chipotle presence is achieved by the combination of jalapenos and natural smoke flavoring (a barley malt product), rather than, apparently, peppers that have been smoked over wood chips.  Those for whom chipotle means fiery may not appreciate the &quot;medium&quot; level of heat in this product.	2004-03-21

I had to depend on gifts from them or when I would visit for my supply. It became a tradition for my sister, sister-in-law, my mom, and I to have Market Spice tea at our family Christmas party each year. It makes the whole house smell wonderful and nothing beats the slightly sweet, spicy taste. I am so glad Amazon has it available now and I can get some any time, especially since I have gotten several of my friends hooked on it too. Although I no longer have to make my supply last I do have a tip. If not used within 6-8 months the tea will get a bitter taste. However I have started storing my tea bags in the refrigerator or freezer and they last a year or longer. However, once you try this tea you'll want to brew all of it up long before then.	2004-03-17

Ross Chocolates Dark tastes great - you almost can't believe that it's low carb. The sensual yet bold dark flavor is completely intact. The texture I find is smoother than standard dark chocolates and, yet, I rather like it better that way.<br />I like to freeze my chocolates and break them off into chunks as needed. Totally yummy. I'll also break off pieces to eat with low-carb ice cream. A real treat there.<br />I purchased several of the other flavors of Ross Chocolates for my husband's birthday. He practically inhaled them all. He gave a piece to our chocolate-loving 7 year old niece who enthusiatically ate it and gave it her seal of approval.<br />The only potential drawback is that it's a bit pricey. But if you need a chocolate fix while on a low-carb diet, this chocolate (or any other of Ross's flavors) will definitely help you. You'll feel like your cheating, but your not.<br />Warning:  Don't eat too much at one sitting. It can have a laxative effect. You've been warned. :-)	2004-03-11

I used to go there and buy pounds of this candy alone... The great thing about these is not the taste (although they do taste great), it is the texture.

US	49156833	R2NGJGT6HCT3RS	B00005NIP1	378769897	Economist	Grocery	5	11	11	N	N	My Favorite Magazine	To date, this is the best, most informative weekly publication I have encountered.  The Economist never fails to cover the stories that really matter in the world, whether they are flashy or not.  Including politics, technology, and the arts, as well as economics, it delves deeper and argues more rationally than any other magazine or newspaper available.<BR>Like all newspapers and magazines, it has an angle.  As its editors freely admit, it was founded in the 19th century with the express purpose of promoting globalization and free trade around the world- a mission which it continues to this day.  Many people mistakenly label the Economist as &quot;conservative&quot;.  The term &quot;liberal&quot; is only used to label those politically or socially (as opposed to economically) left-of-center in the US.  In Britain (the home of this magazine), &quot;liberal&quot; refers to economically liberal- e.g. pro free-trade- a stance more often associated with the right, at least in America.  It is also a uniquely American custom to mix social mores up with politics- a path rarely (if ever) followed in Britain.  (Many Brits consider it absurd, for example, that the debate about abortion in the States is actually in the hands of lawmakers and the judicial system, making it a debate about 'right' and 'wrong' rather than safety and feasability).  Thus, this magazine takes its stands in this British tradition.  It is not steeped in what Americans consider conservative mainstays- Christianity, &quot;traditional&quot; values, or naked hatred toward the welfare state as the root of all evil.  Judgments are rationally made on sound (usually economic) policy, nothing more.<BR>I describe myself as a social liberal and, though I have, on rare occassions, disagreed with some of the stances taken by the Economist, I have never seen a piece of writing between its covers which I considered unfair, or which drew unfounded conclusions.  (Perhaps it helps that I am also pro-global free trade).Rather than a (American-term) conservative mouth-piece, I find this publication refreshingly level-headed and non-partisan.  It is unfortunate there are not more such news sources available.	2004-03-06

I gave him a sampler pak of Ross Chocolates for Valentine's Day, and he loves this chocolate.  He's ordered more of it on his own.  The flavor is very good, and the consistency (what others are calling &quot;mouth feel&quot;) is extremely close to &quot;real&quot; chocolate.  All the flavors are delicious.  My one caution is that it is more expensive to order this chocolate through whatever service is selling this through Amazon than from Ross directly.  A sampler pak direct from Ross is about $13, as compared to the &quot;sale&quot; price of $15 here, allegedly marked down from $22.  One wonders what the mark-up is for.	2004-03-05

A few weeks back I was constipating and my friend recommended me to eat more fiber. So I went to the local store to check out some high fiber cereals. I tried Kashi at first and it was allright. The next couple days, I go there again and found Nature's Path Optimum Slim. I can't believe how perfect it is. It's whole grain, high fiber, and high protein! Not many cereal can boast 11gm of fiber per serving. On top of that, Optimum Slim is USDA Organic. But best of all, it tastes great! I can eat without milk. It's like I was eating Chex mix (no kidding)! Also I might add, as a side effect, I feel full all the time cuz of the fiber and therefore I lost 5 pounds after eating it. My local store sells it at $3.99 and they can't keep it stocked. I'm so happy that Amazon has it for less.	2004-03-05

Although the aroma has a strong note of cocoa from the crushed cocoa shells and beans present as ingredients, there is only a subtle background taste of cocoa. The predominant flavor is cinnamon and ginger. Considering the flavor, I have given this tea only 3 stars because there are better spice teas on the market. But I give it 5 stars for originality. The tea is packaged in keeping with a yoga theme, claiming that it is a tea formulated to uplift body and soul. The box contains instructions on meditation, a note from Yogi Bhajan, the yogi that guides the business practices of the company, and a poem that inspired the illustration of the tea cup on the front of the box. Whether you find this kitschy or useful, it certainly does make for distinctive packaging. Each tea bag is individually wrapped for freshness.<br />Eileen Rieback	2004-03-04

I am a real fan of hot sauce, hot peppers and anything that makes my eyes water, and I have to honestly say that Dave's Insanity Sauce is absolutely the hottest thing I've ever tasted.  I use one drop in about 25 ounces of home-made tomato sauce and it makes the sauce noticibly hot.  This is NOT a sauce to dash into your soup or to liven up some salsa.  DON'T USE IT LIKE TABASCO!!!  It is a heavy-duty hot sauce that should be used as in ingredient when cooking a decent amount of a dish.  My brother doubted its powers so I poked the end of a toothpick into the sauce and gave it to him.  The poor guy freaked and ate more Italian bread than I've ever seen anyone eat in my life.  This bottle will last you a long time.  Why doesn't it get 5 stars?  It's just too hot.	2004-03-01

Tazo has taken Rooibos tea to a new level by blending African Rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, orange peel, rosemary, and lemon balm.<br /><br />Rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of a fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an African veld fire. I remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. Now I mix in powdered milk and honey. Honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend.<br /><br />For some reason, this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel.<br /><br />I've recently rediscovered the health benefits of Rooibos although I can truly say I've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. Rooibos is naturally sweet, very aromatic and is high in magnesium, calcium, iron and copper. Mothers in Africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic.<br /><br />An application of cold Rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies, indigestion, insomnia and nervous tension. Just drinking the tea seems to improve your skin due to the high antioxidant levels, 50 times that of green tea!<br /><br />This is one of the Tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. If you enjoy this tea, you might also want to try Tazo Honeybush tea. I must say that the Tazo company really has my attention with their packaging, amusing tales of ancient Tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-02-29

Unlike FOX News, whose &quot;reporters&quot; pretty much say whatever Rupert tells them to, or CNN, which often seems like the adult version of the old kids' show with Gary Gnu (&quot;No Gnus is Good Gnus&quot;), or the pro-American big business magazines in the states, The Economist provides deep and insightful analysis of global issues.  It does have a lean - it is of course pro-free markets, pro-trade, and pro-capitalism - but it does not hide this lean, and neither do I.  What's great is that when the writers of the Economist give their opinion, they tell you flat out that it is their opinion that they are giving; it's not hidden in sentimentally-charged rhetoric.  It is also pro-science, pro-technology, pro-reason, and pro-progress, which is something foreign to American-style conservatism, the adherents of which tend to rely on religiously-based and highly sentimental rhetoric to back the claims they make.  (For one example, The Economist has maintained for years a compelling economic argument that drugs should be legalized.)  The Economist is much closer to the spirit of those who founded this country, more interesting and persuasive than either its conservative or semi-liberal counterparts in America, and, frankly, makes a lot of sense on most issues.	2004-02-19

The tea tastes like hot cinnamon candies often used to decorate cookies for Valentines day.  The tea is sweet, yet spicy.  According to the Harney literature, the tea contains no sugar, but to taste the tea you will insist that it has sugar in it.  I think the sweet taste comes from the sweet cloves used within the tea.  The aroma is wonderful from the moment the tea is opened.   <br />I must say I was highly impressed with the tea.  The tea is available both loose and bagged.	2004-02-18

These are from limited production plantations, all at the highest elevations designed to produce the best beans.  Antigua once was part of this select group but now can be purchased separately.  It is a coffee that is deeply fragrant, pungent, smooth as a wine. This is a spectacular coffee as are all those in this series. One must note that the king of coffees, Popoyan, is still as good as it always was.  Sadly, I must report that the once great Zimbabwe coffee has been discontinued due to the ravages of the regime against the producers in that once-fair land.	2004-02-15

The result is a wide range of deep, ultra-smooth delicious cup that is intoxicating.<br />By all means, get the whole bean and grind it.  Some have argued that whole bean coffee cheats the buyer since the space between the beans takes up room for the product.  But the taste of the feshly-ground coffee more than makes up for this slight loss in volume - a clear case of quality over quantity.	2004-02-15

Before we moved I packed 4 bottles of Laudemio Olive Oil for our personnal use.  Several months later, I ran out and was ready to shop for it locally.  Thank goodness for the web!!!  Without it, I would never be able to purchase the very best reasonably priced Italian Olive Oil ever made.  <BR>I originally discovered Laudemio 8 years ago, shortly before we moved to California.  I almost cancelled that move until I discovered several stores carrying the product.  However,shopping in Hawaii is a completely different story.  Here, it is almost impossible to find a local source for even the most common ethnic, exotic or non-run of the mill foods.  I could have ordered any olive oil brand online, but Laudemio is my only choice, even if it means waiting for a shipment.       <BR>Laudemio is perfect for dipping, salad dressings, marinades, anything.  Not too strong, nor too overpowering and no too green tasting and very reasonably priced.	2004-02-12

It's rare to find a condiment with both sweetness and tartness combined so well. The fruit flavors come through with a hint of ripe cranberries, and the tartness of currant, but the ginger adds a zing that makes this ideal for those wanting flavorful, fruity but not overly sweet relish. It goes extremely well with Carribean style cuisine (black beans, rice and assorted peppers in a tangy sauce; accompanied by smoked fish and roasted chicken) or with basted roasted leg of lamb and tender spring veggies (asparagus, or fresh young peas).

This is because of its low tannin content.  It is reputedly high in antioxidants (many web sites say this of its main ingredient, the rooibos, or &quot;red bush&quot;).  It reaches full flavor after about 4 minutes steeping, but supposedly continues to release antioxidants if it is steeped even 10-20 minutes.  I like it with 3 teaspoons of raw cane sugar added, but that is not because of any bitterness.	2004-02-10

I dipped a finger in each and couldn't decide which to put on the salad, so I ate three mini bowls with one of each! <br />I started with Very Blue Cheese, which is full of the flavor of its namesake and adds punch to a fresh, crunchy romaine salad. Bold Balsamic tastes wonderful on mixed greens- truly the only readymade vinaigrette that tastes better than something you could whip up at home. The Mango-Lime sounds unconventional, but it has a wonderful tart citrus flavor to balance out the sweetness of the mangoes, and goes well on a spicy green like arugula.<br />These three dressings knock the living daylights out of anything you'd find in a conventional supermarket! You'll want to eat salads for breakfast, lunch and dinner!	2004-02-05

Roaring 40's Blue is a wonderful mixture of strength and subtlety.. it's almost impossible to guess what flavour is going to break through next.  It's superb on thin crackers and with a glass of good red wine. I tried this at a cheese tasting during the Adelaide Royal Show (in South Australia) and was immediately won over, as were the literally hundreds of people lined up to try it for themselves.  I'm of the opinion that once you've had King Island cheese, you never go back!  Try it for yourself!	2004-02-05

(If you happen to have a meat thermometer -- that is medium well.)<br />***DON'T boil the water**** it leaves the coffee tasting bitter and horrible.<br />Hotter water gives you more bitter coffee, but takes less grinds.  Cooler water gives less bitter more flavorful coffee, but uses lots and lots of grinds to get full flavor.<br />Now, pour the water through the grinds in your melita filter and into your cup.<br />Mmmmmm java-licious.	2004-01-29

I brought this item home (delivered to my office safe, sound, and well sealed) along with a growler of milk stout from our local brewpub. I watched bouncing bikini babes on E! for an hour while chowing down on the cheese and ale.

If you try to chew this caramel, you will notice it sticks to your teeth with a level yet unknown to glue.<br /><br />So, use with caution. I will occasionally treat myself to one of these because they keep me busy while watching a movie.

Grocery	5	5	6	N	N	Delicious Chocolate Shake Variety	The \\"GeniSoy\\" Protein Shakes have always impressed me with their creamy texture and \\"complete nutrition\\" health benefits. It is easy to put a scoop of powder with milk or juice and blend it into a nutritious shake. Frankly, if I had to choose between a milk shake and a Soy Protein shake, I'd choose GeniSoy. Not only because I have seen the great results of taking soy powder, but also because I just feel healthier and this product is not overly sweet. It is just perfect.<br /><br />You can mix up this shake after a workout or drink it as a breakfast shake. Basically, you can drink this at any time of the day and feel good about this Fat-Free and Cholesterol-free product.<br /><br />For the best results, blend this in a shaker or use an electric blender. I've also been adding a scoop of All One Vitamin Powder to the blend.<br /><br />This is my favorite Chocolate Flavor Soy Shake. If you have tried a lot of health shakes in the past few years, you will become very loyal to GeniSoy brand products. They just taste better. I can't wait to try the other flavors since I've only tasted the vanilla and chocolate. I hear they now have a Strawberry Banana flavor. Hey, you can't have too many Soy Protein powders! If you love to workout and also want to keep up with your nutritional needs, try GeniSoy.<br /><br />Also look for the Vanilla Protein Shake.<br /><br />I've been drinking GeniSoy soy drinks for years and years. So far, I have been unable to find a protein drink that tastes<br />this good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-01-26

Life is good.\\" ~tea packet<br /><br />If you want a subtle tea with a smooth, soothing flavor, then Darjeeling is an excellent choice. The slightly floral flavor is much milder than an Earl Grey. I especially love this blend when eating a Caramel Apple Cobbler Clif Bar. For some reason, the flavors mingle nicely. I think it is the slightly nutty flavor of the Darjeeling.<br /><br />While many of the Tazo teas are blends of a variety of teas, this tea is purely a blend of Organic Black Darjeeling teas. The tea is grown near India's border with Bhutan. There are only \\"true Darjeeling\\" tea leaves in this tea.<br /><br />This tea is just perfect when blended with an Organic Sucanat: Natural Sugar Cane. You might also want to try using \\"milk powder\\" instead of cold milk with your tea. I find it helps to keep the tea strength and adds a creamy element to the smoothness of this tea.<br /><br />Darjeeling is a very satisfying blend for morning tea. You might also enjoy AWAKE and Earl Grey if you enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I just love the packaging of the Tazo Teas. The individual wrappings have a nice crinkly sound and the colors are all so soothing and quite beautiful. These teas are definitely for the aesthetically aware. Drinking Tazo teas literally becomes a magical experience. There is something mysterious going on here. The teas even seem to have a magical glint or luster to them. When you drink Tazo teas the world looks more beautiful and you feel much more aware of life itself. I find that my creativity soars after drinking Tazo teas.<br /><br />For more information on the mysteries of Tazo Tea, read the review for the Tazo Assorted Teas.<br /><br />For a calming experience try the Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion which is perfect for quiet evenings, after completing a yoga workout or just to sip on while you write in<br />your journal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-01-25

This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.<br /><br />When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the  \\"dark brown sugar\\" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.<br /><br />Recently I've been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.<br /><br />This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.<br /><br />Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is \\"green cut.\\" This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.<br /><br />If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.<br /><br />If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can't be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2004-01-25

Grocery	5	95	96	N	N	Possibly the best in its price range	As of today, Jan. 25, 2004 Amazon is offering this product from two different merchants at two different prices with two different names. Possibly the confusion comes from the fact the the name of the product is partially in Italian, and every merchant made up its own English name. Anyway, the following two are the same, just buy the cheapest<BR>1. Illy Roasted Espresso Coffee Beans -- Merchant: Goodman's<BR>2. illy Whole Bean Espresso, Normale -- Merchant: CaffeSolo<br />Here is my review of the product itself.<BR>Among coffees in this price range, I haven't been able to find anything better.<BR>I am an italian who came to US 6 years ago (I think it is relevant to readers) and Illy is an italian brand. I claim my review does not have any shallow food-nationalism bias, but it might well be that I am influnced by my upbringing.<BR>This coffee is roasted much less than what americans are used to think as the &quot;italian roast&quot;, Illy calls it &quot;medium roast&quot;. It is roasted less than ANY Starbucks coffee I tried so far. The roasting type can be seen by comparing the colour of the powder. This particular Illy is lighter in color and it is bit reddish. It's color is close to the color of cocoa poweder (I mean cocoa powder processed with alkali).<BR>The roasting is key for me because I dislike any coffee which tastes of burnt -- Illy does not.<BR>It's flavor is marked enough to fully come through even when drank with milk in a 50% coffee 50% milk proportion. It actually still tastes of coffee in this proportions.<BR>Some people prefer Illy Dark Roast (the silver and black) to make espresso, but I prefer the flavor of Medium Roast even to make espresso.<BR>I prepare it with a stove-top espresso machine, such as Bialetti.<BR>This particular tin I am reviewing contains coffee beans, an identical tin (the lid is different) containing grounded coffee (same blend) also exists. The grounded one is grounded having in mind stove-top esperesso machine, which is a powder barely coarser than the one for true electric espresso machines (it can be used in them too) and much finer than grounds for dripping machines.<BR>As you probably know, coffee should be drank very soon after roasting. In general this is true. Illy is one of the leaders in vacuum paking, so the shelf-life of its coffee is very long. The metal can is not just for beauty: it does keep the air out better then bags. Still, you don't want to buy it from a merchant who had it on its shelf forever.<BR>All in all, there is better coffee around, but I can't find any better for this price either for delivery on the internet or from small roasters who roast their own coffee in the New Haven area.	2004-01-25

I like drinking herbal teas, so this is the perfect combo.  I must say it has a distinctive taste, and some people may not like it, but you can always add honey and lemon to it.  I cannot say enough great things about this product for sore throats.  A must-have during the cold/flu season...	2004-01-23

I tried one, and it was like biting into dirt.  Maybe we got a bad batch, because we like the lemon shortbread and that pecan shortbread.  But these were nasty.	2004-01-22

This is my first experience purchasing and using dried pears since I live in a place where specialty items like this are not easily found.  This is the best price available of the varieties offered on Amazon, and the company responds immediately, with low shipping charges.<br />The product is unsulphered, which may be prefered by some.  Its texture is tough.  Its flavor is present but muted, rather like canned pears.  That said, when braised in a little chicken broth, the dried pears perked up and did what they were supposed to do in a wild rice pilaf dish.  I'll definitely soak them before adding to breads or cookies.<br />The next time I order, though, I may try Melissa's, to compare quality.	2004-01-22

Possibly the confusion comes from the fact the the name of the product is partially in Italian, and every merchant made up its own English name. Anyway, the following three are the same, just buy the cheapest<br />1. Caffe in Grano 8.8 oz, Whole Bean -- Merchant: A.G. Ferrari Foods<br />2. Illy Roasted Espresso Coffee Beans -- Merchant: Goodman's<br />3. illy Whole Bean Espresso, Normale -- Merchant: CaffeSolo<br />Here is my review of the product itself.<br />Among coffees in this price range, I haven't been able to find anything better.<br />I am an italian who came to US 6 years ago (I think it is relevant to readers) and Illy is an italian brand. I claim my review does not have any shallow food-nationalism bias, but it might well be that I am influnced by my upbringing.<br />This coffee is roasted much less than what americans are used to think as the &quot;italian roast&quot;, Illy calls it &quot;medium roast&quot;. It is roasted less than ANY Starbucks coffee I tried so far. The roasting type can be seen by comparing the colour of the powder. This particular Illy is lighter in color and it is bit reddish. It's color is close to the color of cocoa poweder (I mean cocoa powder processed with alkali).<br />The roasting is key for me because I dislike any coffee which tastes of burnt -- Illy does not.<br />It's flavor is marked enough to fully come through even when drank with milk in a 50% coffee 50% milk proportion. It actually still tastes of coffee in this proportions.<br />Some people prefer Illy Dark Roast (the silver and black) to make espresso, but I prefer the flavor of Medium Roast even to make espresso.<br />I prepare it with a stove-top espresso machine, such as Bialetti.<br />This particular tin I am reviewing contains coffee beans, an identical tin (the lid is different) containing grounded coffee (same blend) also exists. The grounded one is grounded having in mind stove-top esperesso machine, which is a powder barely coarser than the one for true electric espresso machines (it can be used in them too) and much finer than grounds for dripping machines.<br />As you probably know, coffee should be drank very soon after roasting. In general this is true. Illy is one of the leaders in vacuum paking, so the shelf-life of its coffee is very long. The metal can is not just for beauty: it does keep the air out better then bags. Still, you don't want to buy it from a merchant who had it on its shelf forever.<br />All in all, there is better coffee around, but I can't find any better for this price either for delivery on the internet or from small roasters who roast their own coffee in the New Haven area.ounded one is grounded having in mind stove-top esperesso machine, which is a powder barely coarser than the one for true electric espresso machines (it can be used in them too) and much finer than grounds for dripping machines.<BR>As you probably know, coffee should be drank very soon after roasting.

I got some of this blend thinking that it would be a little different on steamed vegetables or greens, but when I tried it on eggs, I was astounded!  Used sparingly, it really makes plain old scrambled eggs into a taste treat.<br />The key  with all of these spice blends is to USE SPARINGLY!  I've used most of the other blends as well - a little goes a long way towards creating subtle overtones in your dishes.  Another good one is &quot;Are You Game?&quot;  Mostly I use that for meat dishes, but it's really good in lasagne and spaghetti sauce too.	2004-01-21

Grocery	5	3	3	N	N	The best herbal tea I've ever found	I found this tea in a specialty shop while at university 4 years ago.  It was so good I went through countless boxes.  It has such a sweet, licorice taste... with just a hint of black pepper... and the lingering aftertaste is outstanding.  When I left school, I never thought of stocking-up before moving away.  I spent the next 4 years buying any kind of licorice tea I could find, trying to replace this tea.  None of the teas I tried even came close to comparing.  Then, when I saw Amazon had a gourmet food store, I decided to search for this tea - and was amazed to find it.  I ordered 5 boxes - and was happy to find out it was just as good as I had remembered.	2004-01-20

I wasn't able to read the preparation instructions since they were in Japanese, so I had a friend translate for me.  Then I found it in the U.S. and realized that the instructions he gave me were not at all a translation, but they are better than what's printed on the box.  So disregard the printed directions and use my recipe instead!  1 lb. chicken, 1 large onion, 3 medium potatoes (peeled), 2 carrots (peeled).  Cut all the preceding into medium-sized pieces.  Brown the onion and chicken.  Add 3-4 cups of water and the potatoes and carrots.  Cook for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are done.  Remove from heat and add the Golden Curry (cut it into pieces for easier melting).  Mix well and it's soooooo tasty!  Serve over rice or udon noodles.  5 servings?  HA!  3 servings for people with normal appetites.	2004-01-12

Blair isn't joking: that plastic skull is a cogent, stark warning not to take this sauce lightly.  And another note: this isn't so much a sauce as it is an additive.<br />Here's how you can literally fire up your mouth: take one 24 ounce jar of generic hot salsa from your supermarket.  Let's say you laugh at their idea of &quot;hot&quot;, which means you're ready to go with Blair's Sudden Death Sauce.<br />Put the salsa in a blender.  Do not blend yet.  Pour about 1/4&quot; of water in the empty jar, shake it up, pour into the blender (get all of your salsa's worth).  Put four-six drops of Blair's into the blender.  Cover and blend on &quot;Liquify&quot;.<br />Pour into a serving bowl.  Take a nacho chip, dip, and eat.  Now run to your  kitchen sink, and stick your mouth under the tap.  After five minutes, the burning should stop.<br />Repeat until the bag of chips are gone.<br />I add a few drops to canned chicken soup, and it really makes it far more tasty and hot than you could ever buy.  I'm impressed at how tasty the sauce really is, if you use it properly.  It takes a little practice to get the right balance of flavor-to-hot, but it really does add flavor to soups, salads, chili (man, does it ever), hamburger, just about anything.  A single bottle might last you about three months, and you'll sneer at lesser sauces in your grocer's aisles.<br />fred	2004-01-09

Simply put the tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves.<br /><br />The sensual blend of exotic spices, teas and herbs used in their teas include a mixture of the following: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers.<br /><br />This is a blend of black teas, but all their teas are worth trying.

When I came to live in the US it was very difficult to find them and I sorely missed them. <BR>Now they are omnipresent and I don't miss them anymore. My knowledge and taste for chocolate has evolved since, so I find them too sweet and I can taste the vanillin (used instead of the more expensive vanilla). I would not buy a box for private consumption, or for a gift, but I do pick up one, once in a while, next to a shop chash register in memory of the time past.<BR>OK, but what are they?<BR>Each of them looks like a small truffle. The filling is gianduja chocolate (gianduja chocolate is milk chcolate with hazelnut powder mixed until it forms a paste. It is basically like Nutella, just denser), with small pieces of hazelnut and at least one full hazelnut on top. The whole thing is covered by dark chocolate.<BR>It looks like they are in fashion now, because I see them everywhere	2004-01-07

Could be even better	This is good, but other brands are better.<BR>Torrone is the italian way of making nougat. This torrone is the hazelnut one in  the usual white paste (honey, sugar and something else that I don't remember). This particular torrone is the \\"morbido\\" version, by now prevalent. \\"Morbido\\" meas \\"soft\\". Actually, in this product a lot of the white paste is softer even for the morbido type; it is almost fluid.<BR>This particular product is a variation of torrone, quite popular in Piedmont during Winter Vacations. Is a variation because it has other things besides torrone itself. This particular brand has 2 layers: 1 torrone layer and 1 layer of rum chocolate (it is rum chocolate paste; it is not chocolate filled with rum liquor). The whole thing is covered with dark chocolate. The dark chocolate is very, very thick below constituting a 3rd layer. On top and to the side the chocolate it thinner: just a cover to keep the hole thing together.<BR>The rum flavor is strong (in a good sense) and the hazelnut is strong too, but could/should be stronger.<BR>By now I got so snotty with chocolate that I can see how the chocolate could be better (both the chocolate in chocolate-rum paste) and the chocolate in the covering. Anyway, as a whole this torrone al rhum e cioccolato is quite good, and until I can find the brand I was used to in Italy I'll keep on buying it.<BR>	2004-01-07

They were just as good as any shrimp I've bought in a grocery store, though far from the best I've tasted.<br />While they were good, I will probably just buy my shrimp from the grocery store as the taste is comparable and then I don't have to pay for shipping.  They were decent shrimp though, so I recommend them to people who live in areas where shrimp is not readily available.	2004-01-06

We were really shocked at how delicious and tasty this coffee is - I bought it based on the Amazon reviews and they were right on. I decided these deserved another good review after I tried a Starbucks pod this morning and had to throw it out it was so terrible - it had no flavor and tasted watered down even though I made the correct amount (1 oz.) I have been lavishing praise on our espresso machine, which it does deserve, but I have now realized that the Espressione pods are the big reason that we've fallen so in love with our home espressos. The coffee is very flavorful, richly so. The price is also competitive when ordered in bulk like this, a great deal (these pods come out to be $.40 each whereas the Starbucks pods were $.41 each). They are certainly worth more.<br />One caveat, make sure to order the 100% Arabica pods - you would be well advised to always buy Arabica coffee as it is far superior to coffee made with the cheaper, more acidic Robusto beans.	2004-01-06

Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans are incredibly delicious for anyone who likes the taste of fresh coffee and fine chocolate. This combination cannot be beat! I gave several 5 pound bags to friends and colleagues for holiday gifts and received rave reviews and profuse thanks. This is a terrific and unusual gift idea. The chocolate covered beans keep for a long time in an airtight container, or gallon zip-lock bags. Best stored in a cool place - not the refrigerator. I love them!! ENJOY!!<br />JANA	2003-12-30

It is &quot;gourmet-priced&quot; candy, but still a reasonably priced treat that's well worth it. It is far, far better than the crud that's passed off as black licorice in this country! (no wonder so many people say they dislike it!)<br />Kookaburra Black Licorice is the real, old-fashioned licorice deal, in HUGE pieces that are perfect for a mid-day licorice fix.<BR>Buy a bag for your fellow licorice lovers, or invite a supposed black-licorice hater to try the real deal--they just might change their minds...This would also make a great, inexpensive just-for-the-heck-of-it gift for an elderly person who fondly remembers the taste of REAL licorice.<br />Oh yeah, one little word of warning though: Real licorice can have a mild laxative effect in some people. :)	2003-12-30

The rice is aromatic ans has a nutty almost sweet flavor that adds a wonderful richess to many savory dishes.  While I don't use this with asian dishes (I think there is too much flavor) I use this in most other things.  It adds a great flavor to stuffings, rice pilafs and plain cooked meant to be served with a topping (like a meat/veggie mix).  It holds its own against thick flavored sauces and its a real winner on my table.<br />I usually will wash this rice a few times before cooking to carry away some of the starch.  Some people would find this rinses some flavor but as long as you dont over-do the pre-rinse you will be fine.  It works especially will when briefly sauteed in butter or olive oil proir to cooking. That will accentuate all the wonderful naturally occuring nutty traits.<br />The grains are generally separate and get longer rather than plumper when cooked.  So if you are expecting a very plump grain you may have a hard to deciding when its done.  I have used this in a rice cooker and found it needs quite a bit more water than the rice cooker directions suggest (just as an fyi in case you open the lid and find dry grains at the top, like I did)<br />As an all purpose rice I just love this.  Its a flavor that works very well with most savory dishes and I think you will enjoy the texture once you experieince it	2003-12-21

Sriracha, on the other hand, is a common sauce in Thailand and is named after the largest harbor in that country.  This version, made in California, is a wonderful diversion from Tabasco-like sauces.  Although made with peppers and relatively hot, the sauce has a generous helping of garlic taste that really perks up food.  It's ideal for Asian recipes, but it can be used with any food to which you want to add some heat, including soups, pasta, and chicken wings (the company also has a website that includes some excellent recipes).  The sauce comes in a handy plastic squeeze bottle that is ideal for squirting just the right amount into your food.  If you're tired of the usual old hot sauce, give Sriracha a try.	2003-12-19

Texture while cold seems gritty upon scooping out, but goes on smooth upon application. If heated, turns completely liquid.  Left mine by a heating element accidently and I thought someone had poured water into the jar. Firmed back up on window sill.  I used this product for after bath with great results. Used it on the kids.  Used it for sauteing something when I ran out of regular oil. Worked fine. I didn't rate 5 stars because I didn't like the idea of scooping it out while firm which is my preferred texture for body application.

When used for breading they make a light yet crispy coating...The are different than traditional *american type* crumbs in the way that soft powder snow is different than heavy packed snow.<br />The crumbs themselves are larger and irregularly shaped so as they lie on eachother they don't form a dense compressed breading but one with substance that still remains airy.  Their flavor is very light and seasoning is needed but this is a plus for me as I can season to taste.<br />I have also mixed these with traditional bread crumbs at times as these tend to be expensive for a lighter style coating but still essentially very much like all panko dishes.  I tend to use a light egg wash with these as I find using just eggs to dip the meat/poulty/fish in a bit heavy for these crumbs.<br />In general I find these far superior for coating food.  These aren't the kind of bread crumbs I use for adding bulk (ie meatloaf, meatballs etc).  I have been using these for a few years now an there is a huge difference between these and the others.  I think if you try them you will really enjoy the light crisp crusts you can achieve...	2003-12-18

First, Alsace is NOT German speaking as is mentioned above. Say that to an Alsatian and you're likely to start a fight. Second, while this cheese is one of the strongest smelling cheeses I can think of, the strength of the cheese changes drastically depending on age.  That is to say that most Alsatians consider this a seasonal cheese; most young Munsters are quite mild in flavor, given their smell anyway. Old Munsters are exceedingly strong. Therefore, it would be quite a gamble to buy this cheese online without knowing the age or the state of the cheese. With all that said this cheese might very well be worth the gamble. In Alsace it is also quite common to sprinkle the cheese with caraway seeds. In addition to the wine pairings (try an Alsatian Tokay), it goes great with beer (Alsatian or German beers, though my favorite is Hoegaarden).	2003-12-17

Oatmeal choc chunk doesn't sound as unique as the Chipotle dble fudge chunk...until you try it.  I don't know if it's the all-natural ingredients or what...you have to experience it.

Wow.  I was not prepared for the heat.  These are not olives with some heat; they are heat with some olive flavor.  After my blood pressure returned to normal, I had a couple more olives. <br />I really like them.  My only warning is to be prepared.

All in an attempt to ease the heat.  It helped only a bit.  <br />After about 2 hours, I was almost back to normal.<br />It is that hot.  I would think that only 1 drop would heat up a pot of chili.

The flavor is more smoky and complex than Tabasco and other popular hot sauces.  Although it goes perfectly with almost any kind Mexican or Southwestern food, it's also a great compliment to a variety of other dishes, including spaghetti and soups.  In addition, the sodium content is relatively low - 110mg per teaspoon (many comparable brands have 200-250mg), making it an excellent, low-sodium way to add flavor to your food.  Most highly recommended.	2003-12-15

It is a wonderful item that adds *restuant-quality* to your soups, stocks, sauces and flavored rices.  Including a teaspoon of this to a recipe (even if you have alread added stock) brings a body and taste that isn't usually expected in cooking outside a professional cooking.<br />I have tried this flavor as well as the chicken and roasted chicken and they are all excellent.  It is the essenese of  stock cooked down to  a very thick paste/gel consistancy.  You can use this in water to make a stock but I have found that adding a small amount to what ever stock you normally use is very good and more cost effective.<br />Once opened it will stay good a little while in the fridge. I have kept it about a week after opening.  If I am going to have it longer I will portion it up into small pieces and freeze the pieces individually.<br />It is not a salted item like a soup stock cube which is very welcome.  If you want more flavor you just can add more without worrying that you item will become so salty you won't be able to eat it.  You can season according to your own preference.<br />I have found this a great help to add to home made soup stocks that are a bit weak in body and flavor.  I have also added it to things like risotto and stir frys.  Its a wonderful, although not inexpensive pantry item.	2003-12-14

Unlike some snack food that can be swallowed almost without chewing ...this has a nice chewy consistancy.  It is sweet but not overly so (take into consideration that mangos are pretty sweet and the dried ones probably more so, so these are sweeter than dried apricots or peaches.  They probably are more on the line of dried pineapple)<br />I had originally got these to try to find more healthy options for my son to eat.  I thought maybe the taste and consistancy would be similar to fruit roll ups and that he would like them.  In the end, I ended up liking them much more than he did.  Perhaps you need to be a mango fan to begin with to enjoy them.<br />I buy them every once in a while as I find them an expensive dried fruit option but they are my very favorite dried fruit option.	2003-12-14

A classic is romaine lettuce, gorgonzola and apple slices.<br />In contrast, gouda is a milder creamy cheese, great for breads. If cheddar were a starting point, I would say gouda is more creamy. It tends to break and crumble less easily, and really stick to bread surfaces better.<br />Both will make you forget about the normal supermarket colby or cheddar.

Apparently I'm not the only person who loves this drink, it is the leading orange carbonated soft drink in France. What I love most about this drink is the not-too-sweet flavor of the carbonated juice. This is not like the super sweet orange drinks that are normally carbonated. It is more like carbonated water with a splash of real orange juice and flavor.<br /><br />I think I first tasted this juice in a caf&eacute; next to the Moulin Rouge in Paris. At least, that is what I remember when we ate lunch after stepping off the tour bus. Anyway, imagine my surprise when I found it was also being sold over here in local tea shops and grocery stores. And now it is here at our very own Amazon!<br /><br />A deliciously light taste and not overly sweet. Perfect for picnics and parties.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-12-11

There is hardly anything as delicious and fragrant as a mango. Mango nectar can take drinks from ordinary to exotic.

Look for yellow/orange mangoes with a red blush. Mango contains betacryptoxanthin that has protective antioxidant and cancer fighting properties. To Make: Peel and slice the mango, place in a blender. Add mango nectar, orange concentrate, lime juice and ice. Blend until smooth. Serve this drink in tall glasses with straws and decorate with a slice of lime. Makes 2 glasses.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-12-11

I bought a 32 Fl. Oz bottle and before I have even finished half the bottle, already my friends say I look younger. It could also be that I'm putting Aloe Vera Gel all over my entire body. Stephen Cherniske got me started on this juice after reading his book: The Metabolic Plan. It is truly an amazing product!<br /><br />The Lily of the Desert company has a state-of-the-art processing method in which all the \\"aloin\\" is removed. This is the harmful, bitter part of aloe vera. The aloe vera plants are also grown organically. The company follows strict standards established by the Texas Department of Agriculture.<br /><br />Drink 1-8 ounces a day and see amazing results! You can mix this juice into any fruit juice. Often, I make an aloe vera drink with apple cider and grape juice (one ounce aloe vera with 7 ounces additional juice) You can hardly taste the aloe vera in this combination.<br /><br />Drinking aloe vera will encourage anticatabolic benefits by supporting immunity, healthy cell proliferation, collagen production, detoxification, antioxidant activity and intestinal health.<br /><br />Lily of the Desert is a leading producer of Aloe Vera and their products contain high levels of minerals, enzymes, amino acids and vitamins.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewa leading producer of Aloe Vera and their products contain high levels of minerals, enzymes, amino acids and vitamins.    ~The Rebecca Review	2003-12-11

They are the best for motion sickness-even better than Dramamine and without the drowsiness.I suffer from motion sickness and I carry these in my purse to every trip I make-car, boat, plane. They last a long time since you don't need to eat a whole one to reap the benefits. A third of a chew will do-one feels instantly better. It is really great for older children-young kids might find them too spicy. Adults find them addictive because they are so good tasting!!!	2003-12-07

I also appreciate that its flavor is so mild it is hardly perceptible, and does not interfere with the taste of other ingredients. I love it in my favorite salad dressing, which is also a marvelous substitute for butter drizzled on artichokes or asparagus spears:<br />½ cup Hain canola oil<br />the juice of 2 limes<br />1 tsp. of grated fresh ginger (from a peeled chunk or &quot;finger&quot; of ginger)<br />garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.<br />Hain expeller pressed canola oil is wonderful for stir fry dishes, especially the more delicate recipes that include shrimp, and perfect for baked goods, because of its neutral flavor. The nutrition facts per serving of 1 tablespoon are:<br />Calories 120<br />Total Fat 21 %<br />Saturated Fat= 1g, Polyunsaturated Fat=4g, Monounsaturated Fat=8g<br />The only other ingredient in Hain canola oil (as can be found in other high quality canola oils) is 10% all natural Vitamin E, to preserve quality and enhance freshness.<br />(percent daily values based on a 2,000 calorie diet).<br />Canola oil is the lowest in saturated fat compared to other vegetable cooking oils, making it a healthy option when choosing an oil.	2003-12-06

Though if eaten alone they will not tantalize your taste buds, when mixed with other foods will add much to the nutrition of your meal.<br />They are especially important in the daily diet of women, as many experts say that women over the age of 40 benefit greatly from adding soy products to their diet, helping to turn down the heat index of those &quot;hot flashes&quot;.<br />You will be surprised when you open an Eden Black Soy Bean can, that unlike some other brands, it is packed to the top with beans, and with very little liquid; other than the small quantity of water, the only other ingredient in Eden Black Soy Beans is kombu seaweed, and that does not make it taste salty or fishy, in fact, the aftertaste these beans have is slightly sweet. The black beans are somewhat more delicate than their yellow soy bean relatives, and these have been cooked, but still retain their shape, density, and are shiny dark brown in color.<br />The versatility of the soy bean is amazing. It will help your budget and cholesterol level if you mix it in with your ground beef dishes, are excellent in soups, and can be blended into just about anything. I simply add these beans to a salad to make it a complete and satisfying meal.<br />A serving size of ½ a cup provides:<br />Calories: 120<br />Dietary Fiber: 28%<br />Protein (11 g.) 22%<br />and good percentages of calcium ( 8%), potassium (9%), vitamin A (10%), and iron, phophorous, magnesium, and zinc, all at 15% each.

Rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, decaffeinated black tea, cardamom, ginger, chicory, cloves, star anise and other natural flavors seem to take a back seat to the delicious peppery flavor of this tea. This tea tastes similar to a tea I first tasted in Africa, where Rooibos tea is grown.<br /><br />Best served with milk/powdered milk/soy milk or a dash of cream and some honey. Since this is a decaffeinated tea, it is perfect for late night writing sessions or when you want something calming to drink that doesn't taste like chamomile.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-12-06

This popcorn tin makes a wonderful gift for anyone who loves popcorn and likes pretty tins. The tin contains three types of popcorn: carmel, cheesy, and butter. I really don't think the carmel tastes that good and would perfer a box of Cracker Jacks any day. However, the buttered and cheesy corn isn't too bad and tastes slightly better than other brands you can find in stores. You can find tins like these for a much cheaper price in almost any department or grocery store. However, it is worth the price if you know someone who not only likes popcorn, but who wants a home decoration or needs a convenient place to store things.	2003-12-05

This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.<br /><br />Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	2003-12-05

It has none of the qualities that are usually associated with licorice.(harsh anise, black or red twists and vines) The first sensation you taste is sweet and slightly spicy.  My favorite part is the lingering flavor that 'washes' down the back of your throat.  I don't know of any other way to describe it.  It is a truly divine experience to relax with a cup of this tea.  I have found that it takes the full suggested brewing time to fully develop the flavor.	2003-12-04

I of course had very high expectations. I love it; I have gotten my best friend \\"addicted\\" to it.<BR>It is somewhat unexpected. When I first received it it smelled of green wood. Even hot cocoa smelled of green wood, and I was puzzled. I found out that I needed to adjust my recipe for hot cocoa a bit: I used to drink it with no sugar, no vanilla, whole milk. Valrhona is so powerful and rich that even I like to have the tip of a tea spoon of sugar in it. Adding a vanilla bean is great. Great with half&half. It is not overpowered by orange extract or almond extract.<BR>Great for chocolate cookies too.<br />This cocoa is \\"dutch\\" processed, which means that it's acidity is lowered during process of obtaining the cocoa powder from the beans. This is general advice: when you read a recipe you have to make sure whether it calls for \\"regular\\" or \\"dutch\\" processed cocoa powder, otherwise it might not work.<br />Of course this cocoa is for pastry of the highest quality (...)also sold by Amazon in which you can find the most amazing recipes, but I use it to make excellent what I do everyday.<br />Enjoy!	2003-12-03

Although it is milk chocolate (and hence, for me, fatally flawed) it is truly unique milk chocolate, and even a dark-chocolate guy can like it.<BR>First of all, it is the characteristinc Valrhona long lasting flavor effect, that remains into your mouth for one minute or more after you swallaw it.<BR>Second, it is by far the least sweet milk chocolate I ever tried - that's a plus, just in case you have doubts :)<BR>Third, you can feel that caramel was used to replace (in part) ordinary sugar. <BR>All in all, well, if you really prefer milk to dark chocolate, this is a must try.

Also, The Economist leads the news cycle. I have often read an article in The Economist and seen it recycled in The New York Times a week later, then on CNN that night, and then on the network news a few days later. Why settled for a watered-down version of The Economist's original article?<br />While The Economist is serious (no chance Madonna will ever grace it's over), it does have a humorous side and strong British wit (hence the cover with the cactus giving the finger or the decision to run an obituary of Uday and Qusay Hussein).<br />Also, while a news outlet having an agenda is nothing new, the frankness with which The Economist acknowledges its slant is rare. (While it is one of the more \\"fair and balance\\" media outlets out there, it would never make such a claim). It's pro freedom (and not in the warped post-9/11 sense): free trades, free markets, and freedom for citizens from government intervention.<br />Finally, the subscription gives you full access to The Economist's website, which contains a huge archives of articles, along with some reference material.	2003-12-02

I'm not fond at all of their shakes or chocolate syrup (too chemically), though the Atkins ice cream cups are very good, if not exactly just like ice cream. But Ross low-carb chocolate... I could not believe it when I ate a bit after Thanksgiving dinner. There is finally something I can eat that doesn't hurt my diet AND satisfies my (somewhat picky) sweet tooth.  No chemical taste, no aftertaste, no gritty texture. The dark chocolate bar and the orange milk chocolate bar are all I've had so far but I absolutely plan to work my way through all of them.

The result is a fantastic marriage whose combined flavor can put the taste buds into a state of euphoria (if you're not careful!).  Of course, being weight conscious, eating a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup is a treat for me today.  In my humble opinion, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are one of the best confections ever created!

An east Indian dish, Madras soup (named after the town of Madras) is a combination of tomato juice, coconut milk, shredded coconut and various spices.<br />I have been serving it hot on cold holidays and always get requests for the recipe. Getting &quot;A Taste of Thai&quot; sure beats cracking your own coconuts and getting the milk the hard way.  No extra sweeteners are added - just the natural, subtle sweet goodness of coconut.<br />My less than perfect rating is for the lack of a warning to shake before opening and stir well before pouring. The contents settle when sitting on a shelf, so the coconut &quot;meat&quot; portion which is much thicker, rests on the bottom while the thinner viscosity portion pours right out. If you don't stir it well or use the entire can in your recipe, the remaining portion will not be good for much and spoils within a few days of being opened.	2003-11-26

Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids.<br /><br />New Orleaneans (native or adopted, displaced or otherwise) know that red beans and rice is a very subtle dish.  The beans at Dunbar's, Mother's, and Ye Olde College Inn (all famous for the dish) are all different, and everybody's mother has her own recipe, too.  There are many variables involved in getting it to come out just right, from the choice of meat to the number of bay leaves to add to the pot.<br /><br />The most important is in choosing beans.  Red beans and rice cooked by displaced New Orleaneans elsewhere doesn't always come out as creamy as people in the city are used to--often they're thick and starchy and the beans need to be put in a blender to get anything resembling the gravy in the authentic dish.  One reason for this is that Americans outside of New Orleans and the Deep South really don't eat beans, red or otherwise, and the beans sit on the shelf and toughen.  The second reason is that the \\"red kidney bean\\" popular in New Orleans is not the same thing as the kidney bean used in three-bean salad or Texas chili.  It's smaller, hence it cooks faster, gets creamier faster, and has a more intense color and flavor.<br /><br />Camellia beans are authentic Louisiana red beans--the small variety--and they're probably the most popular in New Orleans.  They enjoy such a good reputation because they're almost invariably fresh and they produce the creamy pot of beans that, more than any other dish, reminds us of New Orleans.	2003-11-25

US	50998455	R3OMUAR8S98KRW	B0000DCXC8	315151261	Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale -- Affinato Aged 20-30 Years	Grocery	3	53	55	N	Y	Not As Advertised	I plunked down my $80 for a bottle of the Pedroni \\"Affinato\\" (\\"Affinity\\") balsamic vinegar and was sadly disappointed.  To begin with, it comes with a catalog from A. G. Ferrari Foods which tells you that's it's been aged for \\"at least 12 years,\\" NOT 20 YEARS as stated above.  Whoops, a bad omen.  The next bad omen is this:  Nowhere on the box or the bottle does it actually have the name \\"Affinato\\" or the real age.  It does say Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale, but at this price, I like the label on the product to tell me that it is what I thought I ordered.  And I like to know that they keep track of their aging process better than my wife does (we're celebrating her 39th birthday for the 10th time). <br />Bad omen number three:  When you swirl it around in the bottle, it does coat the inside of the glass briefly - but it is NOT as thick as syrup.  Now, one of the selling points for aceto balsamico that has been awarded the \\"Tradizionale\\" designation is that \\"the real stuff,\\" as Ferrari's catalog calls it, is as thick as syrup and a few luxurious (Ferrari's adjective is \\"voluptuous\\") drops on a slice of Parmigiano Reggiano will give your palate intense pleasure.  Hmmm.  Well, the proof of the pudding is in the tasting.  Let's open it.  <br />My wife and I tried it on the finest Parmigiano Reggiano that money can buy and the most perfect strawberries we could find.  Conclusion:  The \\"Affinato\\" vinegar is sweet-and-sour but not exceptionally complex, and it more or less detracts from the natural taste of a plain strawberry.  On quality Parmesan cheese it is better - but again, we decided we'd rather enjoy the perfection of the Reggiano cheese on its own.  I do think it would go very well with avocado, but we didn't have one handy. <br />Complexity is the point.  Aceto balsamico becomes complex when it is moved from one kind of barrel to another during the aging process.  It spends a few years in oak barrels, then moves on to another kind of wood (they never tell you exactly what) and so on.  From each type of wood it's supposed to pick up subtle nuances of flavor.  It's like winemaking, where for example aging a chardonnay in French oak barrels makes it lose some of its chalky-tasting tannic acid and absorb some of the vanillin that occurs naturally in the wood.  That added vanilla taste gives us what we call an \\"oaky\\" chardonnay.  Alas, the \\"Affinato\\" vinegar is not oaky, not mysteriously subtle, it's just a very good sweet-and-sour vinegar.  <br />They also say you can sip it.  Fair warning:  if you do that, the fumes go up your nose and it makes you cough.  Hey, it's still vinegar.  The best use of the \\"Affinato\\" is to make an oil-and-vinegar salad dressing with extra virgin olive oil and a kiss of garlic, and in that application it makes a truly outstanding dressing.  Lip-smacking.   <br />My wife and I have been using \\"balsamic vinegar\\" that's in the $20 - $25 range for many years.  We looked forward with great anticipation to this step-up to a true \\"Tradizionale\\" aceto balsamico at 3 times the price.  The Tradizionale designation is the equivalent of the &quot;Premier Grand Cru&quot; designation that's awarded to top Bordeaux wines - like Chateau Lafite Rothchild or Chateau Haut Brion - and we were expecting something on that level, where every sip gives you subtle new surprises in flavor.  We didn't get it. <br />One more thing.  Though neither the Ferrari catalog nor the product description above tells you how much you're getting in a bottle of Affinato, it's 100 milliliters (3 fluid ounces).  As for product information, even if you can read Italian, the type font on the label is so small that it literally takes a magnifying glass to read it.    <br />Let me add that I write this negative review reluctantly.  I am one of Amazon.com's greatest fans.  I greatly value Amazon's unique democracy of customer reviews and spend at least a couple thousand dollars a year on Amazon.com.  I've contributed positive, five-star reviews ofbooks and CDs that are really special.  This negative review does not in the least weaken my faith in Amazon, but in this case the product discription is misleading.  <br />Who knows, maybe you'd be better off spending your hard-earned money on Ferrari's $150 Extra Vecchio (\\"Extra Age\\") balsamic, which the catalog states is \\"aged for at least 25 years\\" (not 30 years as stated above).  As for me, I can't afford the experiment.  And so far, what I've tasted from the Merchants of Modena has not lived up to the legend or the hype.	2003-11-23

The flavor is distinctly cheddar, not as sharp as the best full-fat extra sharp cheddars, but it definitely has a presence and stands up to mustard (other lite cheddars tend to taste like American cheese).  We use this for nachos, cheese omelets, and grilled cheese sandwiches.  It melts with grace.  It is good to eat straight, as I've learned when I get it out to shred--people show up and carve off slices, never complaining that it is &quot;lite.&quot;  I do recommend sharing the 10-pound loaf with friends if you have a small household--after a month or so, an opened package, even one that has been carefully wrapped, may suffer some mold.	2003-11-19

As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.  The cake mixes only require water to make.  The first lemon flavored Sweet `N Low cake I made was adequate but did not have any fresh tart lemon flavor.  The next time I tried using half lemon juice and half water and something very strange happened to the texture, it felt like a sponge.  Not a sponge cake but a dish sponge.  I keep trying to find the right amount of lemon juice to add and have not hit on it yet.  If you do not mind a mild and slightly artificial lemon flavor, than this is a great product.  For first time users I wish that the product description here specified that these mixes make a single thin eight-inch layer.  My local grocery store sells the mixes for $2.79 and rarely has flavors other than chocolate or yellow so the price and variety offered here is wonderful news.	2003-11-18

As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.

Then rather than use sugar free frosting (ugggh!) I sprinkle the top with either unsweetened cocoa or with chopped coffee beans.  The bitterness of the cocoa and the coffee beans enhances the sweetness of the cake. These mixes make a very thin eight-inch layer.

We serve them raw or barely cooked and I really can't get enough of them.  I could make a meal on them, but I try to behave and save some for my guests.<br />These oysters are an elegant food, not meant for everyday.  Just knowing they're on the menu helps to put me in a festive, party mood.  Many of our guests have told us that one of the things they love most about our dinner parties are the oyster appetizers.<br />If you've never served oysters as an appetizer to an elegant meal before, you can't go wrong with these.  They will make your meal so much more delicious and so much more memorable.  But one caveat:  Be ready when guests ask you the next time...Are you having oysters?	2003-11-16

We recently received this cheese assortment as a gift and we really loved all of them.<br />Our favorite cheese in this group was definitely the Manchego.  It was decadently rich and creamy and the flavor transported me back to the days when I was a student, hitchhiking my way across Europe.<br />Neither my wife nor I had ever had the Mahon Reserva, but we really liked it.  It's sharp and tangy, so we ate it in much smaller portions than the Manchego.  We had never had the Idiazabal, either, and I have to say this smoky cheese has become one of our family's favorite, rivaling even the Manchego.  It's perfect for cooler weather or to nibble on with an apple, a loaf of crusty bread and a glass of full-bodied Rioja.<br />The Murcia al Vino was divine.  This is a special cheese and one that we love sharing with friends.  All of the cheeses in this Spanish Cheese Assortment make a wonderful gift for yourself or for the cheese lovers in your life.	2003-11-16

My family and I eat it on capelli d'angeli at least once every week.  We add a salad and a loaf of crusty Italian bread and the meal is simple but delicious beyond compare.<br />This brand of Pesto Genovese is one of my alltime favorites.  So many times, Peste Genovese can be too oily, covering up the taste of the basil and the pine nuts.  Not so with this pesto.  Every ingredient seems to be perfectly balanced so you get the freshest, most flavorful Pesto Genovese available.  The taste of the basil and the pine nuts is delicate, but so exquisite.<br />If you like Pesto Genovese or just want a change from more &quot;traditional&quot; tomato sauces, I urge you to give this pesto a try.  I don't think you can go wrong.	2003-11-16

My only regret is that I live in an area that usually doesn't get cold enough to really enjoy fondue to its fullest.  To compensate (and because we love winter), my wife and I often go to the mountains where it does snow and when we do, one of the first things we enjoy is Swiss fondue.<br />I've found that the cheeses in this assortment make a wonderful and very authentic Swiss fondue.  Just be sure to have a loaf of crusty French bread handy as well as white wine and kirsch.  And don't skimp on the kirsch; it really makes the fondue special.<br />My family and I have found that fondue is best served the traditional Swiss way...as a main course.  It's just too filling for an appetizer and just so good you want to eat your fill!  There's nothing quite as relaxing as a good fondue on a cold winter's night.  This cheese assortment is the first really authentic fondue assortment I've found since my days of backpacking and hitchhiking around Europe.<br />I really can't praise this cheese assortment highly enough.  You really have to make a fondue yourself and taste how good it is to believe it.  Try it!  Please!  Once you do, you'll become an addict!	2003-11-16

I have had smoked salmon from all over the world, even some other brands of salmon from the Copper River in Alaska.

I gave it to my father for his birthday because the packaging was just so beautiful, but when he shared it with me, I couldn't stop eating it!<br />I'm happy to say that this Christmas will be very easy to buy presents, because I'm going to buy this smoked salmon for everyone in my family.

I like the thin, crisp texture of them and the snappy crunch when you eat them.  This flavor is very good with a great balance of saltiness to perk it up.<br />Alot of crackers are quite bland in flavor and while they may be flaky in the sense of baked products do not have the crispy mouth feel of these.  I love these added to a cheese platter (with milder, less sharp cheeses).  These also are good added to a home made party mix recipe(once you are done with the baking and seasoning of the party mix...these don't need the baking of flavoring).<br />These arent the kind of crackers I reach for when I want to add crackers to soup or just want to eat mindlessly in front of the TV (due to cost) but I love these as part of an hors d'ourve, light lunch or small snack.  I love their punchy adult taste and crunchy texture.	2003-11-15

This particular feta comes from northern Greece, specifically the Epirus region. It is not hard like the horrible american cow's milk type of feta, instead coming across as creamy and slightly soft. As a chef and a Greek, it's the only feta that I buy. Use it in salads, cheese pies or even by itself with a little bread and olive oil. Amazon needs to correct the name of it though. It's Dodoni, not Dodino.	2003-11-14

It's probably one of the best &quot;brands&quot; around. But you have to be kidding on the price!! I can take a 5 minute walk to my neighborhood Starbucks where one box (of 24 bags) costs around $4.50. Multiply that by this 6 box bundle and you get $27.00. So what am I paying the extra 2 bucks for, not the dispenser--which is just a cardboard-like box the tea comes! You've got to be kidding me. I thought things were supposed to be cheaper in bulk.

Alas, when I went back to buy some more the store no longer had any.  I have searched my three more popular nearby grocery stores but none carry Joseph's (I shall be asking them to do so!)

This is the same as the the Ginger People's &quot;ginger chews, original, 3oz&quot; also offered by ShopNatural, but this is a 5kg box.  Tasty and pretty addictive, which is why I bought it in this quantity.  Check out the Ginger People web site for recipes and info about their products.<br />One thing to be careful of -- I'm told that these types of candies will go somewhat stale after about a month unless stored in an airtight container.  When you buy the 5kg, it comes in one giant bag in a box, so after you get it you should divide it in individual baggies so that you can save the rest for later.  Or share the candy with lots of friends (or just eat it all yourself within a month.  ;-)  Repackaged, it should stay fresh for up to a year.	2003-11-13

I prefer a good, hearty, european espresso and this coffee fit the bill perfectly.<br />We did some research on this coffee from Espressione and learned many things. It is made from 100% superior Arabica coffee beans, electronically sorted to insure that only the best are chosen. Roasted perfectly and air-cooled, ground and packed into precisely measured pods. Then sealed in a pressurized, modified atmosphere to enhance the aroma and insure freshness. The ESPRESSIONE single-serve espresso pods are designed to drop into your home espresso machine one at a time. There's no mess and no fuss. Just be sure to use an E.S.E compatible espresso machine. <br />It's like having the aroma and taste of Italy in the privacy of your own home. We recommend that you try these coffee pods (we have tried the espresso blend and decaf-both are also great) to enjoy not only the quality, but also the ease in making a quality espresso.	2003-11-13

The BBQ reheats well and impressed all the folks here in Seattle. Order several dozen hushpuppies and keep the toaster oven on to heat them up a few at a time. The only thing King's is really missing is the added flavor of real wood fire. Wilbur's in Goldsboro is still cooking their hogs out back in a pit with real wood.

Big Acres Chipotle Peanut Sauce is not your average peanut sauce.  It is thick (but still smooth) and flavorful, with small chunks of peanut and a nice chipotle-pepper kick!  Great as a dipping sauce - think chicken tenders or grilled chicken on skewers, or even (don't tell anyone) chunks of bread.  Buy the 6-pack because you'll want to use it on everything!  <BR>Added bonus: it's all natural, so you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the ingredients list!	2003-11-10

Here in Texas we sometimes like fire coming out of our ears, but Big Acres is a lot more polite to their dinner guests. So if you are more rowdy than reserved, you might want to throw in some jalapeno on this one. Why not add some zip to their Hot @ Spicy sauce instead? Well, that'd be like gilding the lily, frankly. And I LOVE the maple syrup/dark molasses flavor of this one, with the zip of jalapeno added for &quot;bite.&quot;<br />The best thing about using it straight is that it's not only a good marinade (three or four hours is great, overnight is Special), but you can also use it as a brush-on sauce during cooking. It doesn't overpower the flavor of your barbecue, whether fish, pork, chicken, or beef.<br />Big Acres' Web site has lots of recipes -- try those, too. You'll like 'em.	2003-11-10

Throw a couple of chicken breasts basted with the Teriyaki on the grill, cook up some rice and toss together a salad - easy breezy in under 30 minutes.<br />And the Teriyaki is just the tip of the iceburg when it comes to sauces.

And now I don't have to fly out there to get it!<br />The teriyaki sauce is my favorite. I picked up a sample pack of all the Big Acres' flavors last year, and they're all good, but I am Stuck on the teriyaki. It is especially great with fish. I've never really liked any of my efforts at grilled fish before, but with Big Acres Teriyaki it's no problem at all to wow your dinner guests. It's also great just for dipping (warm it in the oven first). My favorite thing to do is jerked pork or beef, grilled in a cast-iron skillet, and served in a simmering quarter-cup of teriyaki. Stab 'em on toothpicks or party picks and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Yee-ha!<br />It's all natural, with zero preservatives -- but don't worry about how it &quot;keeps&quot; ... there won't be any left over!	2003-11-09

This is an easy, and very versatile, sidedish that goes great with beef &amp; chicken, and pork. I discovered this product when I lived in Georgia, and introduced it to my hubby. We loved it so much that we probably ate it at least once a week because it's easy to prep, inexpensive, and tasty. My favorite (and most simple recipe) for it is to brown some ground beef, cook the Hoppin' John as directed, and then fold in the beef. Instant main dish. In the winter we would take that simple dish, add two cups of Knorr beef boullion broth, and we had a hearty soup. Of course, the product is great simply as a side dish for pork chops, pork roast, baked or fried chicken... whatever! Since we moved to Nevada, we have not been able to locate this particular item among the Zatarain's offerings on the grocer's shelves. I am thrilled to know that it is now only a few clicks away from being in my pantry on a regular basis once again.	2003-11-09

In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<br />Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box.	2003-11-08

I highly recommend it for serious bakers and those who want their desserts to stand out.<br />Bittersweet chocolate is not to be confused with unsweetened; it is a dark chocolate without an overly sweet taste.

A Japanese-American friend of mine introduced me to Pocky a couple of years ago, and I ate two full boxes at that first sitting.  These Almond Crush Pocky are even better than the original chocolate, in my opinion.<br />For anyone unfamiliar with Pocky, they're basically sweet &quot;bread&quot; sticks dipped in chocolate or other flavor icings.  It doesn't sound nearly as good as it tastes, though.  They aren't overly sweet, but they give you a wonderful feeling of decadence.  The Almond Crush Pocky has a light coffee flavor to the icing, and it has -- you guessed it -- crunchy bits of almond mixed into the icing.  The combination of textures is very satisfying.  Try these with tea in the afternoon, alone as a light dessert, with ice cream, or just as a not-so-very-bad-for-you snack.  Enjoy!	2003-11-07

These combine the best of all jelly bean worlds.  The outside has a nice initial crunch and the inside has a clear, chewy taste of whatever is the flavor.  I like some quite a bit...  the watermelon, pink lemonade, cherry, lime, bubble gum and root beer are favorites for me.  Some miss a bit for me...the buttered popcorn comes to mind, for example.  I'm not all that fond of the chocolate either but...<br />With so many flavors to choose from...49 I understand (only jalapano was left out which i actually like quite a bit)there is really something for everyone with this assortment.<br />These beans are really quite small compared to the drug store variety.  And light years better.  With these you can eat one and taste what it really is supposed to be...  if its green, is it lime?  or watermelon? or something else entirely...you WILL be able to tell when you taste it!  I think that is the fun of these...  You arent going to want to throw in a handful of these like you might be tempted to with the cheaper beans...with those you throw a handful in your mouth and just taste...well...*sweet*.  with these if you throw in a handful you will get a riot of different flavors!<br />Savor these...enjoy these...eat them one at a time.  And they are fat free!	2003-10-31

I have been drinking this brand for many years, as this isn't a new product.  It is much loved among many and I can buy it in my area grocery store.<br />It's different from mass produced soda in that it isn't all that sweet as much as it is quite refreshing.  It is excellent iced cold and I prefer it without ice as it has a light flavor.  The texture is more like that of a juice and sparkling water than that of a commerically produced soda.  There are no artificial tastes with this product.<br />The flavor is more on the tart side of the orange spectrum with the hint of tangerine for pizazz... It really is a very good alternative to wine spritzers on hot summer days.	2003-10-31

Shin Ramyun (&quot;ramen&quot; or &quot;instant noodles&quot;) is the most popular brand of ramen in Korea - they sell them everywhere, including 7-Elevens and little hole-in-the-wall restaurants where a nice little old lady will boil it for you with an egg and sliced vegetables and serve it with kimchi and pickled radish. <br />Like all instant noodles, it is very easy to prepare - all you have to do is boil some water and then add the noodles and soup base (all included in the packet) and boil it for appx. three minutes.  The noodles are thicker than most ramen noodles (somewhere in between traditional ramen and udon noodles) and have more substance.  The soup base is salty and very spicy - keep in mind that the less water you add, the spicier it gets. <br />It is very delicious alone or with some added goodies like an egg (crack it in with the soup base when the water is boiling), sliced ham and veggies.  <br />Just make sure you have a large cup of cold water nearby, since the noodles will be both spicy and hot.	2003-10-31

It stores easily and super-convenient to prepare.  All you have to do is add a cup of hot water (or put it all in the microwave for a minute with some cold water) and wait a few minutes for the noodles and reconstituted vegetables to cook up.<br />This particular brand is supposed to be spicy, especially since it is kimchi-flavored.  For those not familiar with Korean food, kimchi is the spicy pickled cabbage that is an absolute staple on the Korean peninsula.  <br />I'm not sure how this particular item made it onto the gourmet list (perhaps simply because it's foreign?).  Nevertheless, it's a decent meal when you have nothing else in the house and don't feel like cooking.  The spicy soup also feels really great when you have a hangover.  For these two reasons, they are especially popular with college guys - I remember that back in college, some of my male friends would have a whole box of it stored under their beds...<br />Anyway, if you like noodles and also like spicy-hot dishes, I think it's definitely worth trying.	2003-10-31

This is quite different from most instant noodles out there - you get noodles with a nice sauce instead of a soup.

You have to first boil the noodles, and then drain some of the water before you add the packets of veggies, sauce, and oil and boil the water down into the Chapaghetti sauce<br />It's a great instant meal but I've found that you have to try it a few times before you get the sauce thickness to your liking (not enough water and it's too dry; too much and it's too watery).	2003-10-31

I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <br />Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <br />Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).

This magazine, which originated in England, mixes together eye- catching economic statistics, important world news, and volatile political situations into one complete magazine.<br />Unlike other news magazines, The Economist is very thorough and very analytical. Instead of just rambling on about an issue and talking in superficial ways, the Economist presents the hard facts. And to help readers get a better understanding, many of these facts are backed up with graphs, tables, and charts throughout the magazine. Since I am interested in the subject of economics and I have studied it extensively in school, I particularly like these graphics and tables. They really help to drive the point home.<br />There's only one bad aspect I can think of with this magazine: the high price. The cover price is $4.95 and a subscription for a year costs more than $100. This is more than double the price of other news magazines, and the cost alone will likely deter many potential readers from giving this magazine a look. I think is's worth the extra cost to get something that's higher in quality, but others will disagree.<br />The Economist, in a nutshell, is a very serious, very intelligent magazine intended for those who want a little more substance and who prefer reading the facts. It's an informative read; educating and fascinating in its coverage of world leaders, world events, and economic changes on a global scale.	2003-10-02
US	52249118	R2K5I2PMDNNEQ	B0000A0BS5	116070868	Starbucks Espresso Roast Dark Roast Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bag	Grocery	2	83	100	N	N	Not actually for use in espresso machines	Few things I'd like to point out:<br />1.  &quot;Espresso&quot; is not a roast.  It's a drink.  In northern Italy they make espresso from Vienna roast, in southern Italy they use French.  Starbucks appears to be using French roast, so they should just label it French roast like any normal person would.<br />2.  The product description says &quot;Taste Espresso Roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. This is one versatile coffee!&quot;  This is patently absurd.  It's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  Here's why:<br />Making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  Making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  If you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  If you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  You get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<br />Therefore, a &quot;Universal Grind&quot; is an impossibility.  They should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<br />3.  It's over-roasted.  Starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  Then they roast all their beans Vienna or French.  Most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not Vienna or French.  So why roast all your beans too dark?  I guess it's just easier that way.  Also, it lets them rename Vienna Roast as &quot;Starbucks Roast&quot; because the Austrians don't seem to care.<br />That said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - Starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<br />Anyway, if you really want somegood coffee, do this:<br />Buy a grinder.  Nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  If you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  If you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  Amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  It's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for Starbucks you should invest in one.<br />Find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  Freshness matters!  Good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<br />Ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  Most people don't use the right amount.  If you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  Not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.	2003-09-25

The regular (all red package) is much less appealing in its flavors, with more of the cereal component that comes with Robusta beans.

In a single magazine, some 35 or 40 countries may be reviewed, with intriguing insights, commentary, and analysis that provokes, insights, and sometimes creates heated debate.<br />I'll admit that sometimes I am surprised by the opinion pieces that The Economist magazine publishes.  For instance, The Economist magazine takes the editorial position that makes it one of the most popular libertarian journals around -- they support free-markets, but yet they appear skeptical of President Bush's tax cuts that make our economy even more free.<br />All the articles are unsigned.  I once asked my professor why this is.  Amazingly, she had no answer.  So I did research on this topic and I learned that the main reason is that The Economist thinks of itself as an organization, where each member sees to it that the organization succeeds.  Thus, some articles have multiple people assisting in the writing and editing.  And that solves the big secret -- how are the articles constructed by this special force known as &quot;anonymous.&quot;<br />My favorite section is Lexington, which The Economist magazine uses to highlight the person of the week they wish to focus on.  Now, if you read Time or Newsweek to learn about a specific person, you often will learn very superficial information about them.  But with The Economist, the information provides scintillating facts and analysis.  Often the article will present both sides to information relating to the person with equal vigor, but at the end will issue The Economist's true position.  A remarkable magazine and well worth the money.	2003-09-13

We try to tell the world about the world, to persuade the expert and reach the amateur, with an injection of opinion and argument.\\"<br />The Economist is written in lively, concise, and often humorous language; it discusses international politics, business, finance, science and technology, and has book reviews and an obituary. Alone, the breadth of topics it covers (and the brevity in which it does so) is enough to set it apart from other newspapers. <br />But The Economist stands out because it refuses to conform to the standards of the industry: it is anonymous (\\"The main reason for anonymity ... is a belief that what is written is more important than who writes it.\\"); it manages to surprise even its dedicated readers; and, it is factual, opinionated and appeals to the highest common denominator, tackling complex and controversial topics.  <br />In the end, though, The Economist has a different selling point: newspapers live by the \\"if it bleeds, it leads\\" rule; The Economist, however, emphasizes the ways in which our lives are becoming better and suggests ways to improve them further. It is this injection of well grounded idealism, rather than an exposure to tragedy, that makes The Economist unique and a pleasure to read.	2003-09-03

At my British high school, it was offered at a discounted rate, presumably because it was (rightly) considered such a valuable educational tool. My understanding of current events has been shaped more by \\"The Economist\\" than any other media source -- the newspaper (as it calls itself) is an education. It does what the best journalism should: educates, informs, entertains, provokes. ... The newspaper has a point of view when discussing ideas. Americans (often told that journalists are unbiased) may find this unfamiliar. In my opinion, the British media (\\"The Economist\\" is British) is more honest than the media in the U.S. in that there is no pretense that journalists lack all personal biases. Readers understand that reporters have clear biases reflected in their stories, & they are able to make up their own minds. This seems fundamentally more honest, easier all round & simpler than the fiction of pure objectivity, which the older I get increasingly seems to me humanly impossible. ... \\"The Economist,\\" however, isn't wedded to political parties. It's quite capable of soundly trashing Republicans & praising Democrats & vice versa, issue to issue. ... That most of the copy is written anonymously has always seemed to me a huge advantage, if hard on reporters' egos. The result is the feeling of reading a newspaper with its own point of view, something so tightly edited it feels like it might all have been written by one person, if one person could cover so much. This is a strength, because it gives the newspaper a distinctive style. ... The writing is outstanding. The reporting is outstanding. The breadth is outstanding. ... Among all the noise out there, I really only need one news source to be well-informed on the most important news, and that's \\"The Economist.\\" Great value for money. You cannot go wrong subscribing and, more importantly, reading. ... And, to the newspaper's credit, its quality & consistency has remained unchanged for the 25 years I've been reading it.And, to the newspaper's credit, its quality & consistency has remained unchanged for the 25 years I've been reading it.	2003-08-31

They have reporters based in countries around the world who report on economics, politics, culture, society, and everything else.  They offer a perspective on international news not easily available in the American press.  This is the only readily available source where you can read about usually-ignored countries, from Uganda to Tahiti.  It provides opinion pieces too (i.e. Lexington), which are wonderfully written and erudite.  All articles are written anonymously by field reporters, putting the focus on the reporting and not the personality. <br />The Economist does assume you know something about the issues, as most of the articles are short and don't provide much background.  But as you continue to read issue after issue, it becomes easier to keep up.  It is a dense magazine, and not one to be flipped through, like Time or Newsweek;  it instead requires time and effort, but rewards with depth and breadth of knowledge. <br />The Economist does have an agenda: it promotes free-trade and democracy (the libertarian form).  It supported George W. Bush in 2000.  However, as a voting Democrat, I can still attest that is refreshing to read a magazine that is not afraid to have an opinion, whether you agree with it or not.  <br />Summary: Bar-none, the best and smartest newsmagazine available.	2003-08-12

This is a newsmagazine par excellence; it is head and shoulders above the rest, and claims (which great justification) to be the newsreporter of the world.<br />'Since its founding by James Wilson in 1843, The Economist has been the world's most enduring and distinguished proponent of free markest and free trade. 'To be sensible without being heavy, to be lively without being silly, to be original without being eccentric,' as editor Geoffrey Gowther stated 50 years ago, has steadfastly been its mission.'<br />This magazine is read by the powerful and the power-hope-fuls in every capital in the world. The Economist prides itself on being one edition, consistent in publication throughout the world; it will not succumb to the temptation of 'regional' editions, which might boost sales but lessen the 'one news source for the world'; it also will not do so, that it may tell those governments which threaten it (hoping for a censoring ability) that they must take it or leave it--when various nations have banned The Economist from their shores, it becomes a hot commodity for smugglers!<br />Until it recently went to regional publications, only once did The Economist make a change; the paper is released on Friday mornings in London, but is already put to print and shipped out for the rest of the world prior to this release. When Margaret Thatcher resigned, the world copies had been issued, but the British printing hadn't been completed. So, they changed the leader. The following week, however, in great integrity, they owned up to the switch, and printed in its entirety the texts of the changed bits.<br />One source for the world.<br />In celebration of the 150th anniversary of the magazine, a special book entitled 'The Pursuit of Reason' was released, which includes an exhaustive survey of the history of the magazine, including some very notable contributors (such as English Constitutional commentator Walter Bagehot, whose name still graces the weekly British political commentary). This was a difficult task of reconstruction, considering that the archives of The Economist prior to the 1940s had been destroyed in the London Blitz.<br />The Economist has a rule of anonymity among authors -- you will find few by-lines on opinions and leaders, and rarely among stories. This helps maintains a sense of 'one voice' for the magazine.<br />This is a publication with power and clout. The Economist first coined the term 'privatisation' to describe the process of putting a nationalised industry back in private property ownership; the newsmagazine's way of saying this was, however, [a term] 'to describe the returning to profitable private motivation of anything that had declined through unprofitable state intervention--in Europe usually through state ownership, in America usually through excessive regulation.'<br />When it began 160 years ago, The Economist had a circulation and readership of a little under 2000; now it has nearly a million, with over 80% outside of Britain. This has caused some changes in the magazine. When I worked in Parliament, it was part of my required duties to go to the newsagent each Friday morning and collect copies of the magazine, and spend the morning with one or two MPs reading over the articles. At that time, the sections on Britain and Europe were much more extensive than they are now. The newsmagazine covers America, Asia, Africa, Finance, Industry, Business; it almost always has a special section supplement on an idea (the internet), a particular country (the country reports are required reading for potential investors and diplomats alike), or some such topic.<br />The Economist has a moderate-conservative social stances, a free-market business and economy bias, and a common sense approach to most issues. It strives to steer clear of social commentary, save when it is of such great import that it is likely to impact on politics or economics. The Economist features short sections for book reviews, science articles, etc., and these are often creative and a little less reigned in by the conventional writers' required standards. But The Economist has maintained a non-affiliation with party politics, rare among British journalists.<br />'The Economist's radicalism and genuine absence of party loyalty lead to much misunderstanding of its position [of wanting a Conservative victory in 1992, under the banner of 'May the Worst Lot Lose'] particularly because of the often arrogant nature of its criticism and its gift for the wounding phrase. The British press in general is so partisan and so predictable that the concept of an independent organ is a difficult one to grasp.'<br />The Economist indeed can be haughty and condescending, scathing and arrogant. But, as the opinions will tell you, they have a right to be. They are usually right. This, of course, is the same attitude of Empire that built the Pax Britannia and free trade as a model that survives to this day. Perhaps a little arrogance is not unwarranted, as The Economist has served as the principal organ of record for the free market for 160 years, and shows no signs of slowing.features short sections for book reviews, science articles, etc., and these are often creative and a little less reigned in by the conventional writers' required standards.

I never missed any issue since then, more and more attracted by the depth of its coverage, the clearness of its analysis, the diversity of topics discussed, and the strange yet appealing mixture of dryness with sense of humour. The newspaper (as it likes to call itself) simply has a sex appeal; Unfortunately, in the recent iraq war, something strange happened to The Economist. It suddenly lost objectivity (in that particular topic) and became very annoying. Don't get me wrong, it has always been provocative (in a good way,) but in iraq, their coverage was becoming ridiculous. It suddenly became preacher in chief for the war, (although i conceed that it did put the most extreme opposition opinions in its letters section), and got transformed suddenly from internationalists to promoters of british interests, complete with sneering at France (they have never admired france anyway). All that has cost them the fifth star that they strongly used to deserve, i hope the economist will revert to its missed self.	2003-06-02

The pods produce a nice crema, equal to the Illy. Most of the pods will be used to produce \\"crema coffe\\" and the flavor stands up well to sugar, flavored syrups, and steamed milk.

If you do not know if there is a brew head for pods available for you machine, contact your dealer / manufacturer - the set up generally runs between thirty and fifty dollars.

Wrigley's really on to something with this chemical concoction, a testimony to the market-driven forces of progress.

But its greatest claim to the consumer's affection for confection is not visual, olfactory or gustatory: it's decidedly tactile.  No gum comes close to this one in the critical areas of texture and viscosity.  The action is positively &quot;springy,&quot; guaranteed to put new life in any user's jaw for all of the stressful events of the day.  And at day's end, when the gum's still going strong and you're not, don't be surprised if you suddenly find a use for that neglected bedpost.	2003-04-05

It contains all kinds of chemicals - the good kind - that make you feel better and give your mouth something to do other than chewing tobacco or mouthing profanities at people (hence its relative popularity among children).<br />However, last father's day, each of my seven children gave me one of these and ran off before I could give them a thankyou peck on the cheek.

This magazine has it all: extensive political coverage and analysis (not just the mainstream stuff that you hear on the networks or read in the daily paper) from all areas of the world. There are areas of literature, technology reports, in depth area reports of different countries, and many other sections, as well as your basic economic stats, graphs and current exchange rates and stuff. The articles are far from stuffy and moreover are written in a witty, tongue in cheek style. I find the style of the Economist to be far more interesting (and daring) than any American periodical that I have encountered. I have also purchased several books from the books review page (they seem to find cool books that I have never seen anywhere else). One drawback? Make time in your schedule to read 100 pages (sometimes more, sometimes less) weekly. I think that it is time well spent. :)	2003-03-17

After years of using Starbuck's decaf and regular single serving espresso pods, I finally found a substitute that's more economical and MUCH better tasting.<br />I've used three different brands of pods in my Starbuck's Barista machine, and have found that the quality of the pod and the flavor of the espresso inside is, by far, the best in the Espressione pods. The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.<br />Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.<br />The tab on each pod is also handy, making it easier to switch out a hot spent pod with a new one when making a second round of espresso.	2003-02-24

It's timely commentary, witty with a strong dose of common sense, allows the reader to stay informed of major (and sometimes minor) happenings around the globe.  The magazine is hardly about economics but rather the reader will gain valuable insights into world politics, world business, economics, technology, and even social issues.  From time to time, they publish a &quot;survey&quot; (an in-depth look) of a nation or an issue.<br />I greatly admire the non-condescending tone of the magazine.  When they state the name of company (even extremely popular global firms), they almost always add what type of firm it is (i.e. bank, consultancy, etc.).<br />Furthermore, as someone who lives in the U.S., it is informative to learn about non-U.S. points of view on American policies (The Economist is mainly centered from England).  The Economist is extremely valuable as it is informative.	2003-02-20

I've tried a couple of these El Paso gift sets at the vastly reduced prices for presents.  I like them so much I kept one of each for entertaining.  The martini has the lowest rating on Amazon and only one review.  The others are highly rated.  I can't figure why the martini set does not have more positive feedback.  It's my favorite.<br />The music CD has some great cocktail standards and some less obvious selections to keep it interesting.  I like the olive design of the glass picks.  The cocktail olives and onions are pretty typical and come in matching bottles.  The drink guide is silly but might be useful to a novice mixologist.  Likely your drunken guests will just look at the pictures!<br />At the list price this is your typical gift set markup ripoff but at the reduced price you could not buy the raw materials in a market let alone add on a swing mix CD.<br />I gave it five stars to offset the two star review and because at the reduced price you really CAN'T go wrong.

You'd be better off spending the money on buying a more expensive brand of gin or vodka. Good quality martini glasses are much more important than any of this. To each his or her own, but in my opinion, a lemon twist makes a better martini than olives or onions. The CD was not the smooth jazz I was expecting.

It is concise, witty, hilarious (honestly, at times I've bursted laughing at their sarcasm), and open-minded. It's amazing that a magazine can cover so much and say so much in about 90 pages week in and week out. For a British publication, they cover a lot of the US. I heavily rely on it to get my news and analyses. And I would say that it is perhaps the only reliable news publication (yes, a big statement). In fact, I cancelled my subscription to Business Week in favor of the Economist.<br />They are also not afraid to tackle difficult subjects like the Israel, race relations, corruption, etc. They give credit where credit is due, and are quick dish out blame as well. No one escapes unscathed.<br />I add that I don't agree with all their views (like when they advocated for Clinton to 'Just go' or when they made the case to legalize drugs), however I feel that there is a little bit of everything for everyone in the magazine. And even if they say something that turns your stomach, at least you'll have something to discuss or be outraged.<br />The best features of this magazine are their technology reports (released quarterly), industry and country surveys, and year-end Christmas, special issue.<br />The magazine is expensive when compared to Time or Newsweek. But the analyses and news coverage you get is certainly worth it. To those that complain about the price, I say you get what you pay for.	2003-01-24

Even if you don't agree with its point of view (and it does have one, a very free-trade oriented, classical liberal, free market viewpoint), it will make you think.  The reporting and the writing are aimed a bit higher than the average newsmagazine, making it a more interesting and thus enjoyable read.<br />The Economist reports the news from around the world, including parts of the world most Americas are not aware of.  It is divided into sections:  US, UK, Europe, Americas, Asia and &quot;rest of the world,&quot; as well as Business, Finance and Science/Culture/Sport.

My only caveat is that I wished there were more than the one Tiramisu and the two Baronie Belgian chocolates (chocolate crunch and cherry truffle), and less of the hard candy. I was not wowed over by the spice cookies either, I would have preferred biscotti or amaretto, spice cookies and hard candy are a dime-a-dozen. The macadamia-nut popcorn reminds me of Screaming Yellow Zonkers, yellow glazed with pieces of roasted macadamias. Yummy!

I've been looking at other platformers and I know that this one is going to be missed be some of the other games out there, but I hope this helps you at least find out what this game is all about.<br />I've been playing this game for about 15 hours and I'm still finishing the third world. I found it hilarious in some cases, and frustrating at times, but over all it's a very fun game. I love the look of the levels and characters.<BR>It gets better and better. It's targeted for the gamer in mind. You won't finish it in a few hours that's for sure.<br />&quot;Quote from a reviewer:<br />The sheer amount of platform games this holiday season is truly uncanny. With the likes of Sly Cooper, Mario, Ratchet and Clank, and Blinx the platform fans are sure to have their fills this x-mas. Midway has decided to join the action with it's quirky title Dr. Muto. A bizarre game about a mad scientist that can morph into creatures after compiling their DNA structure. While this is a truly unique concept, not not original, can this game survive amongst the larger and more widely known characters fighting for your platforming buck? The answer is a resounding yes and even in some way Muto exceeds their efforts. Let's take a look at another perfect example of an underground hit shall we?<br />Graphics<BR>Visually this game is beautiful, large environments sporting some of the most unique architecture this side of Tim Burton. Very organic in it's look and design Muto's worlds are chock full of amazingly animated enemies and colorful hazards such as toxic sludge. The frame rate is as smooth as ice and the animations are flawless. From Muto's outrageous victory dances to the enemies scattering when being trapped this game has style to match it's unique look and feel. The only downsides are a lack of super textures, the ones here are damn good but could be better, and some nice XBox touches like reflections and bump mapping. All in all an absolutely gorgeous game.<br />Sound<BR>Having memorable music is a must in a platform game, you can still hear the Mario theme in your head can you not? Dr. Muto comes across pretty standard in the department. With some typical techno beats mixed with peculiar sound effects the fare seems to drive the game forward, yet it fails to excel or leave anything for you to hum along with. The sound effects on the other hand are top notch, creepy sounds of cockroaches, putrid sounds of liquid and waste, mixed with some excellent voice acting add to the strange personality this game portrays. Dr. Muto himself muttering his &quot;sometimes&quot; understandable lingo to Al your personal computer with his monotone jokes about how the current situation is suitable for a videogame but not a mad scientist are of the highest quality.<br />Gameplay<BR>This is where the game draws you in and doesn't let go. You are in control of Dr. Muto, a mad scientist with the ability to morph into creatures to accomplish goals. Sounds like a simple concept but the best part is the game does it so well by teaching you only what you need to know thus perfecting your skills for the later levels. You use the X button to perform what is called trapping, by trapping so many of the same creature you are given the ability to morph into it. This adds depth and personality and requires you to learn each function continuing to add more game for your buck. The game also switches styles on you from time to time adding challenge and variety, the screen often flips to the side for some old school 2D side scrolling action. Making jumps and timing are key to these challenges and continue to excel this game further in this department. While easy to pick up and taking a good amount of time to master Muto has certainly been designed with gamers in mind!<br />Overall<BR>What this game does it does well and that is deliver a truly unique and fun experience for gamers. If you are a fan of platforming games and are tired of the same old crap then definitely pick this masterpiece up. It will deliver to you many hours of gaming goodness on top of being just downright entertaining to play. Watching this game is almost as fun as playing it and that is a feat less and less achieved in the gaming realm these days. I suggest giving this sleeper a rent, it may mutate your thoughts on platforming games in general.

US	51122671	R2YRZOE28Y374E	B00005NIP1	378769897	Economist	Grocery	2	11	39	N	Y	Good but linear	The Economist is a good magazine but the proscriptions it gives are based on linear, steady-state economics--and in the long run we are all dead.  It gives short term gamesmanship and chaotic theory short shrift (somebody once noted most corporations in the long run go bankrupt, so the short-term is very important for an economy).  As such, it tends to get a bit boring and predictable.<br />Also, as a minor quibble, it is much more liberal (modern sense) and less anti-statist and doom and gloom than it was a while ago, as another poster noted.  I prefer a liberarian, no-government advocacy in op-eds, but that is just an advocacy position, which reasonable people can quibble over.<br />However, all in all, the Economist is good, only because of the poor competition.  And it has great stories if you are international in scope.	2002-11-14

The Economist is well written--\\"witty\\", as other reviewers have said. The articles in a given week will generally have a nice range (aside from America and Britain, the editors try not to make one country appear every week in the news section unless it's crucial). The writers and editors are generally upfront about their views: news articles, as well as the leaders (editorials to Americans) are forthright and opinionated. This is neither the bland \\"news\\" of Time nor the dense prose of an academic journal. It's a news magazine meant for the busy, intelligent professional who needs to know things and has the mental capacity ro process complex issues, but has neither the time nor the patience to wade through endless seas of paper. ...	2002-10-09
US	51141782	RY6UKH11EGH16	B00005NIP1	378769897	Economist	Grocery	5	11	12	N	N	The Preeminent Newsmagazine of the World	The Economist is the most superior newspaper in the world.  Although it is in a magazine format, it's own editors refer to it as a newspaper, and it may be better understood in that context.  Here are a few reasons why it is so superior:<br />- There are no bylines, on any articles.  The Economist maintains the belief that \\"what is written is more important than who wrote it.\\"  This removes opportunities for vanity reporting and grandstanding by authors with agendas.<br />- It's charter prohibits majority ownership by any one particular media group, further cutting down on bias.<br />- Everything written in the magazine must withstand the test of fact.  As such, rumour, conjecture, or any other tabloid type news is not found within it's pages.  As such, it may not break open too many new stories, but you'll certainly never risk embarrasment by saying, \\"well, as I was reading in the Economist...\\"<br />- I've heard, though not verified, that only two news publication can be quoted for doctoral theses in Ivy league schools.  Those are the Christian Science Monitor and the Economist.<br />With a framework like that, you know you are going to be spared the tabloidism of the broadcast media, the \\"lifestyle management\\" of the \\"lite\\" newsmagazines, and be treated to the most thorough and factual analysis of important issues anywhere.  The Economist is one of the few last bastions of JOURNALISM left.  Most so-called \\"news\\" media is really broadcasting, rather than journalism, and as such is more concerned with selling product rather than reporting events.<br />As to concerns with bias, yes the Economist has it's biases, just like any magazine.  However, to attempt to characterize it as \\"liberal\\" or \\"conservative\\" does not make sense in the context of the Economist.  A magazine that is pro-gay rights, pro-euthanasia, and anti-capital punishment, yet at the same time, highly pro-trade, free market and very pro-defense, defies characterization in any one direction.  While you may disagree with it on certain stances, at least you will never wonder how they reached their conclusion.	2002-09-25

US	49320636	R3M49ZQPPGAGYL	B00005NIP1	378769897	Economist	Grocery	5	4	5	N	N	Required Reading	This magazine is absolutely amazing.  The Economist was first suggested to me during a lecture my freshman year in college.  The lecturer was speaking about Supply Chain Management, but he stopped the lecture 10 minutes early and began passionately speaking about The Economist.  It was the passion in his voice that convinced me to try it out.  \\"How good could it possibly be?\\"<br />Admittedly, it took me a while to get into it.  It is very dense, and if you haven't ever really studied world issues, you'll have some catching up to do.  But within 6 months, I was hooked.  I've been (obsessively) reading it now for 3 years, and it has truly changed my life.  Besides giving me a huge advantage over my peers in business (undergrad) school, and helping me maintain my 3.986 cumulative GPA with 2 majors and 2 minors, it has changed the direction of my life.  I'm now studying abroad in Hong Kong, and I plan to work in Latin America and then later in Asia.<br />But, I would suggest this to anyone, whether or not they are in business.  The Economist has a network of reporters all over the world.  It is very well written and it covers a broad range of issues/disciplines/geographical areas.  Unlike most Western media sources, it provides deserved coverage of Africa and Asia.  It is also extremely progressive (and arguably liberal, despite what its critics may say).<br />While reading the magazine, I have been approached by people on subways and in cafes.  \\"You read The Economist?  Isn't it great!?\\"  People who read it know.<br />Read The Economist for 3-6 months... give it that long.  You won't be disappointed.  And if you're reading some [stuff]like \\"Newsweek,\\" burn it.  The Economist is the way to go.	2002-09-20

Asia, Africa, Europe, USA, South America - in politics, economics, science, arts - if its happening, the Economist will probably have something to say about it.<br />You might not always agree with it, but you have to admire its analytical depth and perspective.	2002-09-20

However, I also rely heavily on a Chinese magazine thats more like a left-wing magazine to get another perspective.<br />This is a magazine for people who believe that \\"knowledge is power\\", by reading this magazine, you get an in depth view of the world, thus you can predict the future and make the best/most out of it. Get it now, and you will be one step ahead of the other people.

For one, the quality of reporting is only a few steps above that of a supermarket tabloid.  They are trite, superficial and sensationalistic.  Both were once vital reading, but no longer.<br />The Economist has a very different editorial mission--and a bit of an axe to grind (free markets) which it is very up front about.  It is able to distill the significant world events into a weekly format without loss of quality while providing superior analysis.<br />Critics have complained that The Economist does little true original reporting, relying on news that has already hit television and newspapers around the world.  True enough, yet there is no other publication that gives you the world as succinctly and intelligently as The Economist. <br />Now if it weren't so bloody expensive.	2002-08-16

I am a HUGE lover of Frango's Mint Chocolates and a HUGE lover of ALL things Caramel. I figured, &quot;How can I go wrong&quot;? Well ... I was a little disappointed in the flavor of the Frango Caramels. The caramel filling itself had a slightly stale flavor to it and the filling didn't compliment the chocolate shell the same way the velvety Mint filling does.<br /><br />I will say this ...

US	43213614	R2RCBZS328GP8Y	B00005NIP1	378769897	Economist	Grocery	4	29	37	N	N	Good but not quite perfect	The Economist is certainly the best of the weekly newsmagazine genre but it is not quite perfect.  Back in my college days, I once heard that there was the Economist and then there was Slime, Newspeak and Useless News and World Distort.  I won't disagree.  Its not perfect since, occasionally, the other American newsmagazines will cover some US stories in more detail than will the Economist but then you have to wade through umpteen pointless human interest stories or even stupider stories on celebrities.<br />Over the past 20+ years, roughly how long I've been reading the Economist, its editorial slant has gone from Far Right to Right of Center (assuming that old fashioned Liberals are considered center-right) on economic/financial matters and Left of Center on social issues.  It is very difficult to exactly categorize the publication since it is usually too intelligent to slavishly toe any line other than one of abhorring waste and stupidity.<br />If you are trying to 'pin' it down, the slant of the Economist is in favor of 'market based' solutions to virtually any problem that can be analyzed in those terms:  <br />Trade?  For it!  What about displaced workers?  Retrain them! What if they are too old or too ill-educated to be retrained?  Would be better to buy 'em off with a lump-sum payment!  Net, all of society will still be better off!<br />Pollution?  Against it!  BUT use the market mechanism to reduce it at the lowest cost in terms of jobs lost or firms forced out of business.<br />Abortion?  Pro-choice since it is in favor of maximizing individual choice and responsibilities (the sine qua non of any market society).<br />I think you get the idea.  The particular strength of the Economist is its ability to explain very complex, abstract economic theory in terms any intelligent layman can understand.  (Note:  I do NOT say, &quot;any person&quot; as there are far too many stupid people out there who cannot understand anything, no matter how hard you try to explain it).  The Economist is the best all-round news weekly available but falls behind the Far Eastern Economic Review if that part of the world is what you are interested in.  Short of that, buy it.	2002-07-11

Unlike the fluff that fills the pages of  Time, USNWR, and Newsweek, the Economist covers news that's fit to print, not just what will sell magazines (i.e. no celebrity photos, no \\"God Bless America\\" patriotism, no health-news infotainment, and no avalanche of advertising that falls out of the magazine when you pick it up.).  Unlike Business Week and other business news sources, the Economist isn't into stock picking, cheesy management books, hot sectors, and celebrity investors.  The Economist is about facts, about reporters doing real research, and about consistent excellence.<br />Time, Newsweek, and friends may have their place in the dentist's waiting room, but when I want to know what's going on in the world, or gather facts to make an opinion, the Economist is the first news source at hand.<br />The Economist has<BR>  * detailed news on events all over the globe<BR>  * heads of state, nobel prize winners, company leaders, and informed citizens' opinions on the letters page<BR>  * long surveys of difficult problems (corporate finance problems, Chinese political reform, open source software)<BR>  * real criticism on policies and plans<BR>  * accessible ways to understand complex concepts (i.e. explaining purchasing-power parity by comparing the prices of Big Macs in various countries)<BR>  * remarkably fresh language for such a serious news source<br />I've been reading it for years, starting from high school debate, college libraries, and borrowing copies from friends.  After graduating, I bought it from newstands for a year, and a few months back I gave in and got a three year subscription.  It's expensive, but I'm sure it's money well spent.<br />Besides saving money by subscribing, print subscriptions often include online access, as well.  I haven't used it yet, but I imagine the searchable archives are excellent for research.	2002-06-19
US	42852820	R1I7S88Y2RO6TZ	B00005NIP1	378769897	Economist	Grocery	3	10	30	N	N	Excellent writing from a corporate globalist perspective	Unlike most of the reviewers, I noticed a stong bias in the coverage of the magazine.  The writing is clever and well done, and the breadth of issues covered is quite wide.  They are not writing for dummies, which does make it more enjoyable to read than most weeklies.  For that reason, as well as the fact that I majored in Economics in college, I subscribed for a year.<br />   I enjoyed the 'unbiased' reporting for a few months and then picked up on a quite strong bias actually.  While not being partisan for any political party, it is quite partisan in its 'cosmopolitanism', i.e. it is very pro global business.  Fair enough, by examining the advertisements in the magazine, global business pays a lot of the magazine's bills.  My populist sentiments from a Midwestern upbringing led me to stop my subscription.<br />   Shortly afterwards, I became aware of informal global business powwows, like the Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg.  Often, political leaders are invited to these conferences, as well as central bankers, media figures, NGO leaders as well as business leaders.  They meet once a year, similar to the G-8 meetings.  Anyhow, editors from the Economist are often rapporteurs at these meetings that get almost no coverage in mainstream media.  I recalled the Economist calling Ian Duncan Smith(current leader of the Conservative party in Britain) akin with Atilla the Hun.  Why?  He is(or was) opposed to Britain joining the European Union and wants to keep the Pound.  Who did they support to take over the reins of the Conservative Party?  Kenneth Clark, Bilderberg participant.  When the race for the Conservative Party leadership ended up between these two, and Smith looked like the probable winner, I remember the 'unbiased' Economist suggesting that the Conservative Party might be buying a one-way ticket to the political wilderness if the Conservative Party becomes anti-Europe(pro-Smith), while Labor would become the new center-right party.  If our political process reflected the will of the people(which it doesn't), this statement by the Economist would have been ludicrous.  <br />    The Economist propogates the views of a coterie of central bankers, financiers, and industrialists with a pro-globalism viewpoint.  Not all financiers and industrialists are part of this coterie, Burlusconi for example, but the political goals and institutions of this coterie escape critical analysis.  Fair enough, if they want to propagate their views, that is their own business, but objective it ain't.	2002-06-13

The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper \\"tab\\" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a \\"best if used by\\" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.	2002-06-06

It offers a full range of coverage about politics, world affairs, business, books, arts, culture... and of course, finance and economics.  As an American, I especially appreciate the Economist's outsider perspective on U.S. issues; it puts all the silly things that the American media focus on in a more balanced perspective.  Of particular note, the weekly &quot;Lexington&quot; column offers perhaps the most insightful commentary on U.S. politics of any newspaper or magazine, and it does it with prose that is witty and direct.<br />Many people complain about the price, but let me tell you: it is worth every penny.  I started a subscription on a lark several years ago and thought I would not renew it when it expired, but I became addicted.  It is the only magazine I read.  I eagerly await the mailman's arrival every Saturday afternoon, because I know he'll be bringing me the best and most comprehensive news and analysis magazine in this world.<br />One minor criticism:  if you live in parts of the country that are away from postal hubs, you may not get your magazine on Saturday like you are supposed to.  When I lived in Hawaii, it was always several days late -- and this was maddening.  Even in the Washington DC area, I sometimes wouldn't get my copy until Monday.  But ever since they started printing the U.S. edition of the magazine in California, it has gotten somewhat better.	2002-05-25

Well, for one, I have been reading The Economist for the past twenty years.  Looking back, I believe I have missed only one issue in that entire time.  Reading it has become indepensible.  Indeed, my weekend does not really commence until I have strolled home with the week's edition of The Economist in hand.<br />Through wars, market corrections and the occasional political scandal, The Economist has always provided a critical filter to make sense of what has transpired.  In an ever changing world its unique form of journalism is the one constant I can count on.  I know it will fairly  and succintly present the major issues of the day; oftentimes too with a wit and verve one would not expect from a newspaper that bills itself as a &quot;specialist publication.&quot;<br />So, do not let its dry title fool you.  The Economist is a paragon of journalism for everyman.  An inquiring mind is all one needs to appreciate its merits!	2002-04-15

The information presented in this news magazine is so much better. At first I was wary of the business-centered title and the UK-centric writing. However, it is an incredibly well-rounded magazine covering world politics, business, and a little technology and culture. The British slant is obvious, but there is actually more coverage of the USA and its individual states than anything else. The authors are nameless, but I suspect some writers are clearly Americans by the evident conservative and pro-Bush tone that's so fashionable these days. There is dry humour evident throughout the magazine; occasionally it is a bit inappropriate (in January the subtitle for a photo showing a demolished Afghan city was \\"in need of some refurbishment.\\")<br />The writing style is incredible and one which I would like to follow myself in my own writing. Each article presents a clear opinion on the matter at hand, but the author always presents both sides of the issue in a logical manner. The information is presented with a strict just-the-facts manner. If you want to cut through the [junk], read this magazine. The technology and science articles are suprisingly well-written as well. I can't recommend this rag enough. The only qualm I have is that it's rather expensive, but this is the price you pay for having a magazine that's not filled with mainstream advertisments.	2002-04-07

I was a little suprised with the puffery, but curious enough to see if this little British rag could live up to its own hype.<br />Could it ever. It's the one thing in the world -- sorry New York Times, sorry Wall Street Journal, and I just feel bad for you, USA TODAY -- that can keep you fully aware of global events every week. And not just aware of Europe. Not just aware of British politics. And not just aware of remarkably cogent issues concerning American politics. But knowledgeable about a potential Caribbean stock exchange, Robert Mugabe's worthless leadership in Zimbabwe, and more. <br />When I spent a few months messin around with Eastern Europe, I missed my plane out of Prague, just so I could go back and grab my copy of that week's Economist. I figured, how could I live without it?<br />The thing is, if you care about the world, you can't. Advertising Age said it best -- &quot;Even those who toil in journalism are awed by The Economist.&quot; Would that such a supermodel existed.	2002-02-28

There was a sharp editorial turn to the right in 1978, but it's been ameliorated lately to the more traditional dispassionate (but cutting) neutrality.  Changes in format and style have been more frequent in the recent 5 years (which I have not always endorsed - I'm still not pleased about their switch to color, as I think the black &amp; white forced them to be more trenchant in their illustrations), but where else could one go to find out the political machinations of remote corners of the earth that American magazines never heard of?<BR>It may be hard going to read at first, especially if you're accustomed to the &quot;look boys and girls, today we're going to visit the White House.  Oooh, is that the President we see?  Has he been naughty or nice?&quot; tone of Time and Newsweek.  Stick with it - you'll never go back.  Sometimes the American reporting has appeared to analyze everything according to its effect in Washington DC, but this too shall pass.<BR>The business reporting is spectacular, and there are nuggets throughout each issue in various areas including the frequently oddball statistics in the Economic Indicators section.  Never miss the Letters section: I recall brutal and searing exchanges between Henry Kissinger and William Shawcross when his book on the bombing of Cambodia was reviewed, as just one example.<BR>There is no finer magazine since the demise of Ross's New Yorker.

Though I'm just echoing what many have already mentioned in the reviews before me, I can not emphasize enough how different this publication is compared to the likes of Newsweek and Times.  Please do not be mislead by the magazines title 'The Economist.' While it covers business and the economy in detail it offers so much more, including a detailed analysis of all the major news stories from around the world.The magazine is published weekly in sections which cover all the geographic areas (for in depth news analysis -  and not just when there is a war going on there), Business and Finance, and Arts amongst others.  One of my favorite sections is the one page obituary they always devote to someone of distinction (not necessarily the most famous) every week.The writing is always concise (and always without a byline) and a certain dry humor permeates the magazine throughout.  Sometimes the amount of information contained in the weekly can be a bit overwhelming, but it is always presented in a very clear manner.  The analysis is always well thought out and well researched and typically, the Economist, will not shy away from giving its own opinions.  This is the sort of magazine that you may not always agree with, but one which you will always respect.	2002-01-28

Moreover, the writing is possessed of much greater confidence than is the norm in the press. A recent article on Enron has a nice example of both, it noted: <br />&quot;In August 2001, an Enron employee, Sherron Watkins, had written to her boss, Kenneth Lay, expressing her concern that \\"we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals.\\" If Ms Watkins, whose field was \\"corporate development\\", could see the writing on the wall, surely Andersen should have been able to read it.&quot; <br />Much of the press seems to have no instinct for when to hedge about what allegedly may be true and when to draw sensible conclusions and address the consequences. This inability is the chief cause for the shallow coverage of which many of us are tiring. The Economist, on the other hand, has an almost unerring sense in this regard and it is very refreshing.<br />One note of warning . . . The Economist is the finest monthly newsmagazine currently being published. The only problem is that it comes out once a week. It is tough to keep up.	2002-01-17

The only magazine comparable in the U.S. is U.S. News &amp; World Report and The Economist provides a more detailed and worldly perspective.  If you are an IR/ Econ/ Political Science student or professor, you should subscribe to this magazine.  It's weekly arrival is all you need to satisfy a thirst for more than a superficial coverage of world events received from watching 30 minutes of CNN.  As a former economics instructor, I frequently referred to The Economist for timely, balanced, in-depth coverage of political and economic events throughout the world, including the U.S. &amp; the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the other major regions of the globe.<br />If you manage a tight budget, as many college students do, you can subscribe online to the economist.com and receive a fair amount of material for free.

Unlike other weekly news magazines the Economist covers every corner of the globe in detail, so you can find an article about South America or Africa (and not just when a war is starting). Of course they also offer articles on business, but unlike other publications they avoid all of the silly hype and focus on the facts. Even the book reviews and obituaries are always made interesting to read!

There is much about this album that reminds of the desert southwest sound perfected by Calexico, and yet there sneaks in a hint of Euro-ness that makes their sound unique.  The guitars can offer fuzztones and feedback while the drums pound frenetically, and yet there isn't the sense that the music is directionless.  The vocals are spare and the lyrics won't likely win any poetry contests, but in this context, they work.  This may not be the kind of music that stays in the cd player for weeks on end, but it is a refreshing change of pace.<br />And if nothing else, it hints at what may come from the forthcoming formal Calexico/Amor Belhom Duo collaboration entitled &quot;Tete A Tete&quot;.  That should be one interesting release.	2000-12-05

Being  a  Breyer  collecter  almost  all  of  my  life,  I  would  like  to  say  that  this  toy  is  great!  It  is  so  unique  in  every  way  and  it  is  the  perfect  mold  for  a  show  horse!  This  toy  is  not   only  fun  to  play  with,  but  it  is  also  very  durable  and  strong.   I  think  that  this  toy  is  educational  for  the  horse-lover's  mind.   I  shows  us  what  a  certin  kind  of  horse  would  look  like  without   them  having  to  buy  one.	1999-12-29

This model is beautiful.  each model is hand painted, and looks unique.  these breyer models are hich quality and worth the money, but since there are some very weak parts of the model (like legs and tail) you have to be  careful.  Don't get it wrong, these are pretty strong.  They are not  exactly fragile or anything.... but overall pretty durable.  It is also  totally educational.  The box comes with the name of the breed of horse,  (in this case Bay Pinto) and its realistic features really help you learn  about that particular breed and what it looks like.  The thing i love about  this model and all other breyer models is the close resemblance to the real  thing.  These are not cheesy barbie horses with cheap plastic and  eyelashes...  This could hardly be called a toy.  It is something that  adults could collect, and put around the house as decoration.  Great for  all ages!	1999-11-21

They look more realistic, and very detailed. I will always  collect them, all though I do have real horse of my own, Breyers make great gifts for kids and  grownups who live in the city or cannot afford a horse.	1999-11-17
